    <p>
      Here is a book of Patriotic Stories for children, to stand beside the
      similar collections of Christmas Stories and Thanksgiving Stories, which
      have already been welcomed by many parents, librarians, and teachers.
      Those seeking material appropriate to Washington’s Birthday and the Fourth
      of July will find here a goodly store, ready to their hands. The brief
      descriptive note at the head of each story will help the reader to choose
      one well suited to his audience. And the Table of Contents, as in the
      previous collections, indicates which tales will best please older, and
      which younger children.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Editors hope that a book of stirring tales like these—not history, but
      stories such as children love, that yet ring true in spirit—will serve to
      help, though ever so little, the Cause of Liberty and will aid in keeping
      aglow in the hearts of our young people the ardent spark which inspired
      our forefathers—the Spirit of ’76.

        A story of the “Powder-horn rebellion” at Valley Forge, and of how
        gallant young Jabez Rockwell rallied a retreating regiment at the battle
        of Monmouth.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      “POOH, you are not tall enough to carry a musket. Go with the drums, and
      tootle on that fife you blew at the Battle of Saratoga. Away with you,
      little Jabez, crying for a powder-horn, when grown men like me have not a
      pouch amongst them for a single charge of powder!”
    </p>
    <p>
      A tall, gaunt Vermonter, whose uniform was a woolen bedcover draped to his
      knees, laughed loudly from the doorway of his log hut as he flung these
      taunts at the stripling soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little way down the snowy street of these rude cabins a group of ragged
      comrades was crowding at the heels of a man who hugged a leather apron to
      his chest with both arms. Jabez Rockwell was in hot haste<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_4"
        >[4]</span
      >
      to join the chase; nevertheless he halted to cry back at his critic:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s a lie! I put my fife in my pocket at Saratoga, and I fought with a
      musket as long and ugly as yourself. And a redcoat shot me through the
      arm. If the camp butcher has powder-horns to give away, I deserve one more
      than those raw militia recruits, so wait until you are a veteran of the
      Connecticut line before you laugh at us old soldiers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The youngster stooped to tighten the clumsy wrappings of rags which served
      him for shoes, and hurried on after the little shouting mob which had
      followed the butcher down to the steep hillside of Valley Forge, where he
      stood at bay with his back to the cliff.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are thirty of you desperate villains,” puffed the fat fugitive,
      “and I have only ten horns, which have been saved from the choicest of all
      the cattle I’ve killed these two months gone. I would I had my maul and
      skinning-knife here to defend myself. Take me to headquarters, if there is
      no other way to end this riot. I want no pay for the horns. They are my
      gift to the troops, but, Heaven help me! who is to decide how to divide
      them amongst so many!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stand him on his bald head, and loose the horns from the apron. As they
      fall, he who finds keeps!” roared one of the boisterous party.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Toss them all in the air and let us fight for them,” was another
      suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hapless butcher glared round him with growing<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_5"
        >[5]</span
      >
      dismay. At this rate half the American army would soon be clamoring round
      him, drawn by the chance to add to their poor equipment.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Jabez Rockwell had wriggled under the arms of the shouting
      soldiers, twisting like an uncommonly active eel, until he was close to
      the red-faced butcher. With ready wit the youngster piped up a plan for
      breaking the deadlock:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are thirty of us, you say, that put you to rout, Master Ritter. Let
      us divide the ten horns by lot. Then you can return to your cow-pens with
      a whole skin and a clear conscience.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is more sense in that little carcass of yours than in all those
      big, hulking troopers that could spit you on a bayonet like a sparrow!”
      rumbled Master Ritter. “How shall the lots be drawn?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Away with your lottery!” cried a burly rifleman, whose long hunting-shirt
      whipped in the bitter wind. “The road up the valley is well beaten down.
      The old forge is half a mile away. Do you mark a line, old beef-killing
      Jack, and we will run for our lives. The first ten to touch the stone wall
      of the smithy will take the ten prizes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Some yelled approval, others fiercely opposed, and the wrangling was
      louder than before. Master Ritter, who had plucked up heart, began to
      steal warily from the hillside, hoping to escape in the confusion. A dozen
      hands clutched his collar and leather apron, and jerked him headlong back
      into the argument.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>Young Jabez scrambled to the
      top of the nearest boulder, and ruffled with importance like a turkey-cock
      as he waved his arms to command attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The guard will be turned out and we shall end this fray by cooling our
      heels in the prison huts on the hill,” he declaimed. “If we run a
      foot-race, who is to say which of us first reaches the forge? Again—and I
      say I never served with such thick-witted troops, when I fought under
      General Arnold at Saratoga—those with shoes to their feet have the
      advantage over those that are bound up in bits of cloth and clumsy patches
      of hide. Draw lots, I say, before the picket is down upon us!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The good-natured crowd cheered the boy orator, and hauled him from his
      perch with such hearty thumps that he feared they would break him in two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the noise was hushed as if the wranglers had been stricken dumb.
      Fur-capped heads turned to face down the winding valley, and without need
      of an order the company spread itself along the roadside in a rude, uneven
      line. Every man stood at attention, his head up, his shoulders thrown
      back, hands at his sides. Thus they stood while they watched a little
      group of horsemen trot toward them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In front rode a commanding figure in buff and blue. The tall, lithe frame
      sat the saddle with the graceful ease of the hard-riding Virginia
      fox-hunter. The stern, smooth-shaven face, reddened and roughened by
      exposure to all weathers, lighted with an amiable curiosity<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_7"
        >[7]</span
      >
      at sight of this motley and expectant party, the central figure of which
      was the butcher, Master Ritter, who had dropped to his knees as if praying
      for his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington turned to a sprightly looking, red-haired youth who
      rode at his side, as if calling his attention to this singular tableau.
      The Marquis de Lafayette shrugged his shoulders after the French manner,
      and said, laughingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It ees vat you t’ink? Vill they make ready to kill ’im? Vat they do?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Just behind them pounded General Mühlenberg, the clergyman who had doffed
      his gown for the uniform of a brigadier, stalwart, swarthy, laughter in
      his piercing eyes as he commented:
    </p>
    <p>
      “To the rescue! The victim is a worthy member of my old Pennsylvania
      flock. This doth savor of a soldier’s court-martial for honest Jacob
      Ritter.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The cavalcade halted, and the soldiers saluted, tongue-tied and
      embarrassed, scuffling, and prodding one another’s ribs in an attempt to
      urge a spokesman forward, while General Washington gazed down at them as
      if demanding an explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The butcher was about to make a stammering attempt when the string of his
      apron parted, and the ten cow-horns were scattered in the snow. He dived
      in pursuit of them, and his speech was never made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because Jabez Rockwell was too light and slender to make much resistance,
      he was first to be pushed into the foreground, and found himself nearest
      the commander-in-chief.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> He
      made the best of a bad matter, and his frank young face flushed hotly as
      he doffed his battered cap and bowed low.
    </p>
    <p>
      “May it please the general, we were in a good-natured dispute touching the
      matter of those ten cow-horns which the butcher brought amongst us to his
      peril. There are more muskets than pouches in our street, and we are
      debating a fair way to divide them. It is—it is exceedingly bold, sir, but
      dare we ask you to suggest a way out of the trouble which preys sorely on
      the butcher’s mind and body?”
    </p>
    <p>
      A fleeting frown troubled the noble face of the chief, and his mouth
      twitched, not with anger but in pain, for the incident brought home to him
      anew that his soldiers, these brave, cheerful, half-clothed, freezing
      followers, were without even the simplest tools of warfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud cleared and he smiled, such a proud, affectionate smile as a
      father shows to sons of his who have deemed no sacrifice too great for
      duty’s sake. His eyes softened as he looked down at the straight stripling
      at his bridle-rein, and replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have asked my advice as a third party, and it is meet that I share in
      the distribution. Follow me to the nearest hut.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His officers wheeled and rode after him, while the bewildered soldiers
      trailed behind, two and two, down the narrow road, greatly wondering
      whether reward or punishment was to be their lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      As for Jabez Rockwell, he strode proudly in the van<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_9"
        >[9]</span
      >
      as guide to the log cabin, and felt his heart flutter as he jumped to the
      head of the charger, while the general dismounted with the agility of a
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to the soldiers, who hung abashed in the road, Washington called:
    </p>
    <p>“Come in, as many of you as can find room!”</p>
    <p>
      The company filled the hut, and made room for those behind by climbing
      into the tiers of bunks filled with boughs to soften the rough-hewn
      planks.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one corner a wood-fire smoldered in a rough stone fireplace, whose
      smoke made even the general cough and sneeze. He stood behind a bench of
      barked logs, and took from his pocket a folded document. Then he picked up
      from the hearth a bit of charcoal, and announced:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I will write down a number between fifteen hundred and two thousand, and
      the ten that guess nearest this number shall be declared the winners of
      the ten horns.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He carefully tore the document into strips, and then into small squares,
      which were passed among the delighted audience. There was a busy
      whispering and scratching of heads. Over in one corner, jammed against the
      wall until he gasped for breath, Jabez Rockwell said to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must guess shrewdly. Methinks he will choose a number halfway between
      fifteen hundred and two thousand. I will write down seventeen hundred and
      fifty. But, stay! Seventeen seventy-six may come first into his mind, the
      glorious year when the independence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10"
        >[10]</span
      >
      of the colonies was declared. But he will surely take it that we, too, are
      thinking of that number, wherefore I will pass it by.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As if reading his thoughts, a comrade curled up in a bunk at Rockwell’s
      elbow muttered:
    </p>
    <p>“Seventeen seventy-six, I haven’t a doubt of it!”</p>
    <p>
      Alas for the cunning surmise of Jabez, the chief did write down
      Independence year, “1776,” and when this verdict was read aloud, the boy
      felt deep disappointment. This was turned to joy, however, when his guess
      of “1750” was found to be among the ten nearest the fateful choice, and
      one of the powder-horns fell to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers pressed back to make way for General Washington as he went
      out of the hut, stooping low that his head might escape the roof-beams.
      Before the party mounted, the boyish Lafayette swung his hat round his
      head and shouted:
    </p>
    <p>“A huzza for ze wise general!”</p>
    <p>The soldiers cheered lustily, and General Mühlenberg followed with:</p>
    <p>
      “Now a cheer for the Declaration of Independence and for the soldier who
      wrote down ‘Seventeen seventy-six.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington bowed in his saddle, and the shouting followed his
      clattering train up the valley on his daily tour of inspection. He left
      behind him a new-fledged hero in the person of Jabez Rockwell whose bold
      tactics had won him a powder-horn and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11"
        >[11]</span
      >
      given his comrades the rarest hour of the dreary winter at Valley Forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his leisure time he scraped and polished the horn, fitted it with a
      wooden stopper and cord, and with greatest care and labor scratched upon
      its gleaming surface these words:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      <i
        >Jabez Rockwell, Ridgeway, Conn.—His Horn.<br />
        Made in Camp at Valley Forge</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Thin and pale, but with unbroken spirit, this sixteen-year-old veteran
      drilled and marched and braved picket duty in zero weather, often without
      a scrap of meat to brace his ration for a week on end; but he survived
      with no worse damage than sundry frostbites. In early spring he was
      assigned to duty as a sentinel of the company which guarded the path that
      led up the hill to the headquarters of the commander-in-chief. Here he
      learned much to make the condition of his comrades seem more hopeless and
      forlorn than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hard-riding scouting parties came into camp with reports of forays as far
      as the suburbs of Philadelphia, twenty miles away. Spies disguised as
      farmers returned with stories of visits into the heart of the capital city
      held by the enemy. This gossip and information, which the young sentinel
      picked up bit by bit, he pieced together to make a picture of an
      invincible, veteran British army, waiting to fall upon the huddled mob of
      “rebels” at Valley Forge, and sweep them away like chaff. He heard it over
      and over again, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
      Hessians, with their tall and gleaming brass hats and fierce moustaches,
      “were dreadful to look upon,” that the British Grenadiers, who tramped the
      Philadelphia streets in legions, “were like moving ranks of stone wall.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Jabez would look out across the valley, and perhaps see an American
      regiment at drill, without uniforms, ranks half-filled, looking like an
      array of scarecrows. His heart would sink, despite his memories of
      Saratoga; and in such dark hours he could not believe it possible even for
      General Washington to win a battle in the coming summer campaign.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on a bright day of June that Capt. Allan McLane, the leader of
      scouts, galloped past the huts of the sentinels, and shouted as he rode:
    </p>
    <p>
      “The British have marched out of Philadelphia! I have just cut my way
      through their skirmishers over in New Jersey!”
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later orderlies were buzzing out of the old stone house at
      headquarters like bees from a hive, with orders for the troops to be ready
      to march. As Jabez Rockwell hurried to rejoin his regiment, men were
      shouting the glad news along the green valley, with songs and cheers and
      laughter. They fell in as a fighting army, and left behind them the tragic
      story of their winter at Valley Forge, as the trailing columns swept
      beyond the Schuylkill into the wide and smiling farm lands of
      Pennsylvania.
    </p>
    <p>
      Summer heat now blistered the dusty faces that had been for so long blue
      and pinched with hunger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
      cold. A week of glad marching and full rations carried Washington’s
      awakened army into New Jersey, by which time the troops knew their chief
      was leading them to block the British retreat from Philadelphia.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jabez Rockwell, marching with the Connecticut Brigade, had forgotten his
      fears of the brass-capped Hessians and the stone-wall Grenadiers. One
      night they camped near Monmouth village, and scouts brought in the tidings
      that the British were within sight. In the long summer twilight Jabez
      climbed a little knoll hard by, and caught a glimpse of the white tents of
      the Queen’s Rangers, hardly beyond musketshot. Before daybreak a rattle of
      firing woke him and he scrambled out, to find that the pickets were
      already exchanging shots.
    </p>
    <p>
      He picked up his old musket, and chewing a hunk of dry bread for
      breakfast, joined his company drawn up in a pasture. Knapsacks were piled
      near Freehold Meeting-house, and the troops marched ahead, not knowing
      where they were sent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Across the wooded fields Jabez saw the lines of red splotches which
      gleamed in the early sunlight and he knew these were British troops. The
      rattling musket-fire became a grinding roar, and the deeper note of
      artillery boomed into the tumult. A battle had begun, yet the Connecticut
      Brigade was stewing in the heat hour after hour, impatient, troubled,
      wondering why they had no part to play. As the forenoon dragged along the
      men became sullen and weary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>When at last an order came
      it was not to advance, but to retreat. Falling back, they found themselves
      near their camping-place. Valley Forge had not quenched the faith of Jabez
      Rockwell in General Washington’s power to conquer any odds, but now he
      felt such dismay as brought hot tears to his eyes. On both sides of his
      regiment American troops were streaming to the rear, their columns broken
      and straggling. It seemed as if the whole army was fleeing from the
      veterans of Clinton and Cornwallis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jabez flung himself into a cornfield, and hid his face in his arms. Round
      him his comrades were muttering their anger and despair. He fumbled for
      his canteen, and his fingers closed round his powder-horn. “General
      Washington did not give you to me to run away with,” he whispered; and
      then his parched lips moved in a little prayer:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Dear Lord, help us to beat the British this day, and give me a chance to
      empty my powder-horn before night. Thou hast been with General Washington
      and me ever since last year. Please don’t desert us now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was he surprised when, as if in direct answer to his petition, he rose
      to see the chief riding through the troop lines, but such a chief as he
      had never before known. The kindly face was aflame with anger, and
      streaked with dust and sweat. The powerful horse he rode was lathered, and
      its heaving flanks were scarred from hard-driven spurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the commander passed the regiment, his staff in a<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_15"
        >[15]</span
      >
      whirlwind at his heels, Jabez heard him shout in a great voice vibrant
      with rage and grief:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I cannot believe the army is retreating. I ordered a general advance. Who
      dared to give such an order! Advance those lines——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It was General Lee’s order to retreat,” Jabez heard an officer stammer in
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington vanished in a moment, with a storm of cheers in his wake. Jabez
      was content to wait for orders now. He believed the Battle of Monmouth as
      good as won.
    </p>
    <p>
      His recollection of the next few hours was jumbled and hazy. He knew that
      the regiment went forward, and then the white smoke of musket-fire closed
      down before him. Now and then the summer breeze made rifts in this
      stifling cloud, and he saw it streaked with spouting fire. He aimed his
      old musket at that other foggy line beyond the rail fence, whose top was
      lined with men in coats of red and green and black.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly his officers began running to and fro, and a shout ran down the
      thin line:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stand steady, Connecticut! Save your fire! Aim low! Here comes a charge!”
    </p>
    <p>
      A tidal wave of red and brass broke through the gaps in the rail fence,
      and the sunlight rippled along a wavering line of British bayonets. They
      crept nearer, nearer, until Jabez could see the grim ferocity, the bared
      teeth, the staring eyes of the dreaded Grenadiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the command to fire he pulled trigger, and the kick<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_16"
        >[16]</span
      >
      of his musket made him grunt with pain. Pulling the stopper from his
      powder-horn with his teeth, Jabez poured in a charge, and was ramming the
      bullet home when he felt his right leg double under him and burn as if
      red-hot iron had seared it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the charging tide of Grenadiers swept over him. He felt their
      hobnailed heels bite into his back; then his head felt queer, and he
      closed his eyes. When he found himself trying to rise, he saw, as through
      a mist, his regiment falling back, driven from their ground by the first
      shock of the charge. He groaned in agony of spirit. What would General
      Washington say?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jabez was now behind the headlong British column, which heeded him not. He
      was in a little part of the field cleared of fighting, for the moment,
      except for the wounded, who dotted the trampled grass. The smoke had
      drifted away, for the swaying lines in front of him were locked in the
      frightful embrace of cold steel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy staggered to his feet, with his musket as a crutch, and his wound
      was forgotten. He was given strength to his need by the spirit of a great
      purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alone he stood and reeled, while he beckoned, passionately, imploringly,
      his arm outstretched toward his broken regiment. The lull in the firing
      made a moment of strange quiet, broken only by groans, and the hard,
      gasping curses of men locked in the death-grip. Therefore, the shrill
      young voice carried far, as he shouted:
    </p>
    <p>“Come back, Connecticut! I’m waiting for you!”</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>His captain heard the boy,
      and waved his sword with hoarse cries to his men. They caught sight of the
      lonely little figure in the background, and his cry went to their hearts,
      and a great wave of rage and shame swept the line like a prairie fire.
      Like a landslide the men of Connecticut swept forward to recapture the
      ground they had yielded. Back fell the British before a countercharge they
      could not withstand, back beyond the rail fence. Nor was there refuge even
      there, for, shattered and spent, they were smashed to fragments in a flank
      attack driven home in the nick of time by the American reserves.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a low hill to the right of this action General Washington had paused
      to view the charge just when his line gave way. He sent an officer in hot
      haste for reserves, and waited for them where he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it happened that his eye swept the littered field from which Jabez
      Rockwell rose, as one from the dead, to rally his comrades, alone,
      undaunted, pathetic beyond words. A little later two privates were
      carrying to the rear the wounded lad, who had been picked up alive and
      conscious. They halted to salute their commander-in-chief, and laid their
      burden down as the general drew rein and said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Take this man to my quarters, and see to it that he has every possible
      attention. I saw him save a regiment and retake a position.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The limp figure on the litter of boughs raised itself on an elbow, and
      said very feebly:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“I didn’t want to see that
      powder-horn disgraced, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>With a smile of recognition General Washington responded:</p>
    <p>
      “The powder-horn? I remember. <i>You</i> are the lad who led the
      powder-horn rebellion at Valley Forge. And I wrote down ‘Seventeen
      seventy-six.’ You have used it well, my boy. I will not forget.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jabez Rockwell was able to rejoin his company, he scratched upon the
      powder-horn this addition to the legend he had carved at Valley Forge:
    </p>
    <p class="center"><i>First used at Monmouth, June 28, 1778.</i></p>
    <p>
      A hundred years later the grandson of Jabez Rockwell hung the powder-horn
      in the old stone house at Valley Forge which had been General Washington’s
      headquarters. And if you should chance to see it there you will find that
      the young soldier added one more line to the rough inscription:
    </p>
    <p class="center"><i>Last used at Yorktown, 1781.</i></p>

        A picture of Evacuation Day in New York, in 1783, when the British
        troops hauled down their flag and sailed away from free America. A
        little lost lord, his distracted Tory grandfather, and some kind-hearted
        American children are the principal characters. And we are told how
        little Mistress Dolly Duane “won the distinguished honor of being kissed
        by both Commanders-in-Chief on the same eventful day.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      IT WAS the 25th of November, 1783—a brilliant day, clear, crisp, and
      invigorating, with just enough of frosty air to flush the eager cheeks and
      nip the inquisitive noses of every boy and girl in the excited crowd that
      filled the Bowery lane from Harlem to the barriers, and pressed fast upon
      the heels of General Knox’s advance detachment of Continental troops
      marching to the position assigned them, near the “tea-water pump.” In the
      Duane mansion a fire was blazing brightly and Mistress Dolly’s pet cat was
      purring comfortably in the cheerful light. But Mistress Dolly herself
      cared just now for neither cat nor comfort. She, too, was on the highway
      watching for the exciting events that were to make this Evacuation Day in
      New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> York one of the most
      memorable occasions in the history of the chief American city.
    </p>
    <p>
      At some points the crowd was especially pushing and persistent, and
      Mistress Dolly Duane was decidedly uncomfortable. For little Dolly
      detested crowds, as, in fact, she detested everything that interfered with
      the comfort of a certain dainty little maiden of thirteen. And she was
      just on the point of expressing to her cousin, young Edward Livingston,
      her regret that they had not stayed to witness the procession from the
      tumbledown gateway of the Duane country-house, near the King’s Bridge
      road, when, out from the crowd, came the sound of a child’s voice, shrill
      and complaining.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Keep off, you big, bad man!” it said; “keep off and let me pass! How dare
      you crowd me so, you wicked rebels?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rebels, hey?” a harsh and mocking voice exclaimed. “Rebels! Heard ye
      that, mates? Well crowed, my little cockerel. Let’s have a look at you,”
      and a burly arm rudely parted the pushing crowd and dragged out of the
      press a slight, dark-haired little fellow of seven or eight, clad in
      velvet and ruffles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Put me down! Put me down, I say!” screamed the boy, his small face
      flushed with passion. “Put me down, I tell you, or I’ll bid Angevine
      horsewhip you!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hark to the little Tory,” growled his captor. “A rare young bird, now,
      isn’t he? Horsewhip <i>us</i>, d’ye say—us, free American citizens? And
      who may you be, my little beggar?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>“I am no beggar, you bad
      man,” cried the child angrily. “I am the little lord of the manor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord of the manor! Ho, ho, ho!” laughed the big fellow. “Give us grace,
      your worship,” he said, with mock humility. “Lord of the manor! Look at
      him, mates,” and he held the struggling little lad toward the laughing
      crowd. “Why, there are no lords nor manors now in free America, my
      bantam.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But I am, I tell you!” protested the boy. “That’s what my grandfather
      calls me—oh, where is he? Take me to him, please: he calls me the little
      lord of the manor.”
    </p>
    <p>“Who’s your grandfather?” demanded the man.</p>
    <p>
      “Who? Why, don’t you know?” the “little lord” asked incredulously.
      “Everybody knows my grandfather, I thought. He is Colonel Phillipse, Baron
      of Phillipsbourg, and lord of the manor; and he’ll kill you if you hurt
      me,” he added defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Phillipse, the king of Yonckers! Phillipse, the fat old Tory of West
      Chester! A prize, a prize, mates!” shouted the bully. “What say you? Shall
      we hold this young bantling hostage for the tainted Tory, his grandfather,
      and when once we get the old fellow serve him as we did the refugee at
      Wall-kill t’ other day?”
    </p>
    <p>“What did you do?” the crowd asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Faith, we tarred and feathered him well, put a hog-yoke on his neck and a
      cow-bell, too, and then rode him on a rail till he cheered for the
      Congress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Treat my grandfather like that—my good grandfather?<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_22"
        >[22]</span
      >
      You shall not! you dare not!” cried the small Phillipse, with a flood of
      angry tears, as he struggled and fought in his captor’s clutch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly Duane’s kindly heart was filled with pity at the rough usage of the
      “little lord.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sir,” she said, as she pushed through the crowd and laid her hand on
      the big bully’s arm, “let the child go. ’Tis unmannerly to treat him as
      you do, and you’re very, very cruel.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow turned roughly around and looked down into Dolly’s disturbed
      and protesting face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What, another of ’em?” he said surlily. “Why, the place is full of little
      Tories.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, no; no Tory I!” said indignant Dolly. “My father is Mr. Duane, and he
      is no Tory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mr. Duane, of the Congress?” “Give up the lad to the maid.” “Why harm the
      child?” came mingled voices from the crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What care I for Duane!” said the bully contemptuously. “One man’s as good
      as another now in free America—isn’t he? Bah! you’re all cowards; but I
      know when I’ve got a good thing. You don’t bag a Phillipse every day, I’ll
      warrant you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No; but we bag other game once in a while,” said Dolly’s cousin, young
      Edward Livingston, pushing his way to her side. “We bag turncoats, and
      thieves, and murthering runagates sometimes, even in ‘free America’; and
      we know what to do with them when we do bag them. Friends,” he cried,
      turning to the crowd,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> “do
      you know this fellow? He’s a greater prize than the little Phillipse. ’Tis
      Big Jake of the Saw-mill—a ‘skinner’ one day and a ‘cow-boy’ next, as it
      suits his fancy and as it brings him booty. I know him, and so does the
      water-guard. I am Livingston, of Clermont Manor. Let down the lad, man, or
      we’ll turn you over to the town-major. He’d like rarely to have a chance
      at you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd uttered a cry of rage as it closed excitedly around the burly
      member of the lawless gang that had preyed upon the defenceless people of
      the lower Hudson during the years of war and raid. The bully paled at the
      sound, and loosed his hold upon the little Phillipse. Without waiting to
      see the issue, young Livingston dragged the “little lord” from the throng,
      while his companion, Master Clinton, hurried Dolly along, and they were
      soon free from the crowd that was dealing roughly enough with Big Jake of
      the Saw-mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, Dolly, let us go back to the farm before we get into further
      trouble,” said Cousin Ned, a pleasant young fellow of eighteen, who looked
      upon himself as the lawful protector of “the children.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But what shall we do with our little lord of the manor, Cousin Ned?”
      asked Dolly.
    </p>
    <p>“The safest plan is to take him with us,” he replied.</p>
    <p>
      “Oh, no, sir; no,” pleaded the little boy. “We sail to-day with Sir Guy
      Carleton, and what will grandfather do without me?” And then he told them
      how, early that morning, he had slipped away from Angevine,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_24"
        >[24]</span
      >
      Colonel Phillipse’s body-servant, passed through the barriers and strolled
      up the Bowery lane to see the “rebel soldiers”; how he had lost his way in
      the crowd, and was in sore distress and danger until Dolly interfered; and
      how he thanked them “over and over again” for protecting him. But “Oh,
      please, I must go back to my grandfather,” he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Mistress Dolly had a mind of her own, and she warmly championed the
      cause of the “lost little lord,” as she called him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Cousin Ned,” she said, “of course he must go to his grandfather, and of
      course we must take him. Think how I should feel if they tried to keep me
      from my father!” and Dolly’s sympathetic eyes filled at the dreadful
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But how can we take him?” asked Cousin Ned. “How can we get past the
      barriers?”
    </p>
    <p>
      A hundred years ago New York City proper extended northward only as far as
      the present post-office, and during the Revolution a line of earthworks
      was thrown across the island at that point to defend it against assault
      from the north. The British sentinels at these barriers were not to give
      up their posts to the Americans until one o’clock on this eventful
      Evacuation Day, and Cousin Ned, therefore, could not well see how they
      could pass the sentries.
    </p>
    <p>
      But young Master Clinton, a bright, curly-haired boy of thirteen, said
      confidently: “Oh, that’s easily done.” And then, with a knowledge of the
      highways<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span> and byways which
      many rambles through the dear old town had given him, he unfolded his
      plan. “See here,” he said; “we’ll turn down the Monument lane, just below
      us, cut across through General Mortier’s woods to Mr. Nicholas Bayard’s,
      and so on to the Ranelagh Gardens. From there we can easily get over to
      the Broad Way and the Murray Street barrier before General Knox gets to
      the Fresh Water, where he has been ordered to halt until one o’clock. When
      the guard at the barrier knows that we have the little Baron of
      Phillipsbourg with us, and has handled the two York sixpences you will
      give him, of course he’ll let us pass. So, don’t you see, we can fix this
      little boy all right, and, better yet, can see King George’s men go out
      and our troops come in, and make just a splendid day of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly, fully alive to these glorious possibilities, clapped her hands
      delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What a brain the boy has!” said young Livingston. “Keep on, my son,” he
      said patronizingly, “and you’ll make a great man yet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So I mean to be,” said De Witt Clinton cheerily, and then, heading the
      little group, he followed out the route he had proposed. Ere long the
      barriers were safely passed, Cousin Ned was two York sixpences out of
      pocket, and the young people stood within the British lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And now, where may we find your grandfather, little one?” Cousin Ned
      inquired, as they halted on the Broad Way beneath one of the tall poplars
      that lined that old-time street.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>The little Phillipse could
      not well reply. The noise and confusion that filled the city had well-nigh
      turned his head. For what with the departing English troops, the
      disconsolate loyalist refugees hurrying for transportation to distant
      English ports, and the zealous citizens who were making great preparations
      to welcome the incoming soldiers of the Congress, the streets of the
      little city were full of bustle and excitement. The boy said his
      grandfather might be at the fort; he might be at the King’s Arms Tavern,
      near Stone Street; he might be—he <i>would</i> be—hunting for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Master Clinton suggested: “Let’s go down to Mr. Day’s tavern here in
      Murray Street. He knows me, and, if he can, will find Colonel Phillipse
      for us.” Down into Murray Street therefore they turned, and, near the road
      to Greenwich, saw the tavern—a long, low-roofed house, gable end to the
      street—around which an excited crowd surged and shouted.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, look there,” Master Clinton cried; “look there; and the king’s men
      not yet gone!” and, following the direction of his finger, they saw with
      surprise the stars and stripes, the flag of the new republic, floating
      from the pole before the tavern.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Huzza!” they shouted with the rest, but the “little lord” said, somewhat
      contemptuously, “Why, ’tis the rebel flag—or so my grandfather calls it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rebel no longer, little one,” said Cousin Ned, “as even your good
      grandfather must now admit. But surely,” he added anxiously, “Mr. Day will
      get himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> in trouble by
      raising his flag before our troops come in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      An angry shout now rose from the throng around the flag-staff, and as the
      fringe of small boys scattered and ran in haste, young Livingston caught
      one of them by the arm. “What’s the trouble, lad?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let go!” said the boy, struggling to free himself. “You’d better scatter,
      too, or Cunningham will catch you. He’s ordered down Day’s flag and says
      he’ll clear the crowd.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They all knew who Cunningham was—the cruel and vindictive British
      provost-marshal; the starver of American prisoners and the terror of
      American children. “Come away, quick,” said Cousin Ned. But though they
      drew off at first, curiosity was too strong, and they were soon in the
      crowd again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cunningham, the marshal, stood at the foot of the flag-pole. “Come, you
      rebel cur,” he said to Mr. Day. “I give you two minutes to haul down that
      rag—two minutes, d’ye hear, or into the Provost you go. Your beggarly
      troops are not in possession here yet, and I’ll have no such striped rag
      as that flying in the faces of His Majesty’s forces!”
    </p>
    <p>“There it is, and there it shall stay,” said Day, quietly but firmly.</p>
    <p>Cunningham turned to his guard.</p>
    <p>
      “Arrest that man,” he ordered. “And as for this thing here, I’ll haul it
      down myself,” and seizing the halyards, he began to lower the flag. The
      crowd broke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> out into fierce
      murmurs, uncertain what to do. But in the midst of the tumult the door of
      the tavern flew open, and forth sallied Mrs. Day, “fair, fat, and forty,”
      armed with her trusty broom.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hands off that flag, you villain, and drop my husband!” she cried, and
      before the astonished Cunningham could realize the situation, the broom
      came down thwack! thwack! upon his powdered wig. Old men still lived, not
      thirty years ago, who were boys in that excited crowd, and remembered how
      the powder flew from the stiff white wig and how, amidst jeers and
      laughter, the defeated provost-marshal withdrew from the unequal contest,
      and fled before the resistless sweep of Mrs. Day’s all-conquering broom.
      And the flag did not come down.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the vantage-ground of a projecting “stoop” our young friends had
      indulged in irreverent laughter, and the marshal’s quick ears caught the
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fuming with rage and seeking some one to vent his anger on, he rushed up
      the “stoop” and bade his guard drag down the culprits.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What pestilent young rebels have we here?” he growled. “Who are you?” He
      started as they gave their names. “Livingston? Clinton? Duane?” he
      repeated. “Well, well—a rare lot this of the rebel brood! And who is yon
      young bantling in velvet and ruffles?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You must not stop us, sir,” said the boy, facing the angry marshal. “I am
      the little lord of the manor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29"
        >[29]</span
      >
      and my grandfather is Colonel Phillipse. Sir Guy Carleton is waiting for
      me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, well,” exclaimed the surprised marshal; “here’s a fine to-do! A
      Phillipse in this rebel lot! What does it mean? Have ye kidnapped the lad?
      Here may be some treachery. Bring them along!” and with as much importance
      as if he had captured a whole corps of Washington’s dragoons, instead of a
      few harmless children, the young prisoners were hurried off, followed by
      an indignant crowd. Dolly was considerably frightened, and dark visions of
      the stocks, the whipping-post, and the ducking-stool by the Collect pond
      rose before her eyes. But Cousin Ned whispered: “Don’t be afraid,
      Dolly—’twill all be right”; and Master Clinton even sought to argue with
      the marshal.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are no rebels now, sir,” he said, “since your king has given up the
      fight. You yourselves are rebels, rather, if you restrain us of our
      freedom. I know your king’s proclamation word for word. It says: ‘We do
      hereby strictly charge and command all our officers, both at sea and land,
      and all other our subjects whatsoever, to forbear all acts of hostility,
      either by sea or land, against the United States of America, their vassals
      or subjects, under the penalty of incurring our highest displeasure.’
      Wherefore, Sir,” concluded this wise young pleader, “if you keep us in
      unlawful custody, you do brave your king’s displeasure.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You impudent young rebel——” began Cunningham; but the “little lord”
      interrupted him with: “You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
      shall not take us to jail, sir, I will tell my grandfather, and he will
      make Sir Guy punish you.” And upon this the provost-marshal, whose wrath
      had somewhat cooled, began to fear that he might, perhaps, have exceeded
      his authority, and ere long, with a sour look and a surly word, he set the
      young people free.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      Sir Guy Carleton, K. C. B., commander-in-chief of all His Majesty’s forces
      in the colonies, stood at the foot of the flag-staff on the northern
      bastion of Fort George. Before him filed the departing troops of his king,
      evacuating the pleasant little city they had occupied for more than seven
      years. “There might be seen,” says one of the old records, “the Hessian,
      with his towering, brass-fronted cap, moustache colored with the same
      blacking which colored his shoes, his hair plastered with tallow and
      flour, and reaching in whip-form to his waist. His uniform was a blue
      coat, yellow vest and breeches, and black gaiters. The Highlander, with
      his low checked bonnet, his tartan or plaid, short red coat, his kilt
      above his knees, and they exposed, his hose short and parti-colored. There
      were also the grenadiers of Anspach, with towering yellow caps; the gaudy
      Waldeckers, with their cocked hats edged with yellow scallops; the German
      yägers, and the various corps of English in glittering and gallant pomp.”
      The white-capped waves of the beautiful bay sparkled in the sunlight,
      while the whale-boats, barges, gigs, and launches sped over the water,
      bearing troops and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> refugees
      to the transports, or to the temporary camp on Staten Island. The last act
      of the evacuation was almost completed. But Sir Guy Carleton looked
      troubled. His eye wandered from the departing troops at Whitehall slip to
      the gate at Bowling Green, and then across the parade to the Governor’s
      gardens and the town beyond.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, what word from Colonel Phillipse?” he inquired, as an aide
      hurried to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He bids you go without him, General,” the aide reported. “The boy is not
      yet found, but the Colonel says he will risk seizure rather than leave the
      lad behind.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It cannot well be helped,” said the British commander. “I will myself
      dispatch a line to General Washington, requesting due courtesy and safe
      conduct for Colonel Phillipse and his missing heir. But see—whom have we
      here?” he asked, as across the parade came a rumbling coach, while behind
      it a covered cariole came tearing through the gateway. Ere the bastion on
      which the General stood was reached the cariole drew up with sudden stop.
      Angevine, the black body-servant, sprang to the horses’ heads, and a very
      large man hatless, though richly dressed, descended hastily and flung open
      the door of the coach just as Mistress Dolly was preparing to descend, and
      as he helped her out he caught in his ample arms the little fellow who
      followed close at her heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good; the lost is found!” exclaimed Sir Guy, who had been an interested
      spectator of the pantomime.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>“All is well, General,”
      Colonel Phillipse cried joyfully, as the commander came down from the
      bastion and welcomed the new-comers. “My little lord of the manor is
      found; and, faith, his loss troubled me more than all the attainder and
      forfeiture the rebel Congress can crowd upon me.”
    </p>
    <p>“But how got he here?” Sir Guy asked.</p>
    <p>
      “This fair little lady is both his rescuer and protector,” replied the
      grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>“And who may you be, little mistress?” asked the commander-in-chief.</p>
    <p>
      Dolly made a neat little curtsy, for those were the days of good manners,
      and she was a proper little damsel. “I am Dolly Duane, your Excellency,”
      she said, “daughter of Mr. James Duane of the Congress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Duane!” exclaimed the Colonel; “Well, well, little one, I did not think a
      Phillipse would ever acknowledge himself debtor to a Duane, but now do I
      gladly do it. Bear my compliments to your father, sweet Mistress Dolly,
      and tell him that his old enemy, Phillipse, of Phillipsbourg, will never
      forget the kindly aid of his gentle little daughter, who has this day
      restored a lost lad to a sorrowing grandfather. And let me thus show my
      gratitude for your love and service,” and the very large man, stooping in
      all courtesy before the little girl, laid his hand in blessing on her
      head, and kissed her fair young face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A rare little maiden, truly,” said gallant Sir Guy: “and though I have
      small cause to favor so hot an enemy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33"
        >[33]</span
      >
      of the king as is Mr. James Duane, I admire his dutiful little daughter;
      and thus would I, too, render her love and service,” and the gleaming
      scarlet and gold-laced arms of the courtly old commander encircled fair
      Mistress Dolly, and a hearty kiss fell upon her blushing cheeks. But she
      was equal to the occasion. Raising herself on tiptoe, she dropped a dainty
      kiss upon the General’s smiling face, and said, “Let this, sir, be
      America’s good-bye kiss to your Excellency.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A right royal salute,” said Sir Guy. “Mr. De Lancy, bid the band-master
      give us the farewell march,” and to the strains of appropriate music the
      commander-in-chief and his staff passed down to the boats and the little
      lord of Phillipse Manor waved Mistress Dolly a last farewell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Red Cross of St. George, England’s royal flag, came fluttering
      down from its high staff on the north bastion, and the last of the
      rear-guard wheeled toward the slip. But Cunningham, the provost-marshal,
      still angered by the thought of his discomfiture at Day’s tavern, declared
      roundly that no rebel flag should go up that staff in sight of King
      George’s men. “Come lively now, you blue jackets,” he shouted, turning to
      some of the sailors from the fleet. “Unreeve the halyards, quick; slush
      down the pole; knock off the stepping-cleats! Then let them run their rag
      up if they can.” His orders were quickly obeyed. The halyards were
      speedily cut, the stepping-cleats knocked from the staff, and the tall
      pole covered with grease, so that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34"
        >[34]</span
      >
      none might climb it. And with this final act of unsoldierly discourtesy,
      the memory of which has lived through a hundred busy years, the
      provost-marshal left the now liberated city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Sir Guy’s gallant kiss could not rid Dolly of her fear of
      Cunningham’s frown; but as she scampered off she heard his final order,
      and, hot with indignation, told the news to Cousin Ned and Master Clinton,
      who were in waiting for her on the Bowling Green. The younger lad was for
      stirring up the people to instant action, but just then they heard the
      roll of drums, and, standing near the ruins of King George’s statue,
      watched the advance-guard of the Continental troops as they filed in to
      take possession of the fort. Beneath the high gateway and straight toward
      the north bastion marched the detachment—a troop of horse, a regiment of
      infantry, and a company of artillery. The batteries, the parapets, and the
      ramparts were thronged with cheering people, and Colonel Jackson, halting
      before the flag-staff, ordered up the stars and stripes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The halyards are cut, Colonel,” reported the color-sergeant; “the cleats
      are gone, and the pole is slushed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A mean trick, indeed,” exclaimed the indignant Colonel. “Hallo there,
      lads, will you be outwitted by such a scurvy trick! Look where they wait
      in their boats to give us the laugh. Will you let tainted Tories and
      buttermilk Whigs thus shame us? A gold jacobus to him who will climb the
      staff and reeve the halyards for the stars and stripes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>Dolly’s quick ear caught the
      ringing words. “Oh, Cousin Ned,” she cried, “I saw Jacky Van Arsdale on
      the Bowling Green. Don’t you remember how he climbed the greased pole at
      Clermont, in the May merrying?” and with that she sped across the parade
      and through the gateway, returning soon with a stout sailor-boy of
      fifteen. “Now tell the Colonel you’ll try it, Jacky.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go it, Jack!” shouted Cousin Ned. “I’ll make the gold jacobus two if you
      but reeve the halyards.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I want no money for the job, Master Livingston,” said the sailor-lad.
      “I’ll do it if I can for Mistress Dolly’s sake.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack was an expert climber, but if any of my boy readers think it a simple
      thing to “shin up” a greased pole, just let them try it once—and fail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jack Van Arsdale tried it manfully once, twice, thrice, and each time came
      slipping down covered with slush and shame. And all the watchers in the
      boats off-shore joined in a chorus of laughs and jeers. Jack shook his
      fist at them angrily. “I’ll fix ’em yet,” he said. “If ye’ll but saw me up
      some cleats, and give me hammer and nails, I’ll run that flag to the top
      in spite of all the Tories from ’Sopus to Sandy Hook!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Ready hands and willing feet came to the assistance of the plucky lad.
      Some ran swiftly to Mr. Goelet’s, “the iron-monger’s” in Hanover Square,
      and brought quickly back “a hand-saw, hatchet, hammer, gimlets, and
      nails”; others drew a long board to the bastion, and<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_36"
        >[36]</span
      >
      while one sawed the board into lengths, another split the strips into
      cleats, others bored the nail-holes, and soon young Jack had material
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, tying the halyards around his waist, and filling his jacket pockets
      with cleats and nails, he worked his way up the flag-pole, nailing and
      climbing as he went. And now he reaches the top, now the halyards are
      reeved, and as the beautiful flag goes fluttering up the staff a mighty
      cheer is heard, and a round of thirteen guns salutes the stars and stripes
      and the brave sailor-boy who did the gallant deed!
    </p>
    <p>
      From the city streets came the roll and rumble of distant drums, and Dolly
      and her two companions, following the excited crowd, hastened across
      Hanover Square, and from an excellent outlook in the Fly Market watched
      the whole grand procession as it wound down Queen (now Pearl) Street,
      making its triumphal entry into the welcoming city. First came a corps of
      dragoons, then followed the advance-guard of light infantry and a corps of
      artillery, then more light infantry, a battalion of Massachusetts troops,
      and the rear-guard. As the veterans, with their soiled and faded uniforms,
      filed past, Dolly could not help contrasting them with the brilliant
      appearance of the British troops she had seen in the fort. “Their clothes
      <i>do</i> look worn and rusty,” she said. “But then,” she added, with
      beaming eyes, “they are <i>our</i> soldiers, and that is everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      And now she hears “a great hozaing all down the Fly,” as one record
      queerly puts it, and as the shouts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37"
        >[37]</span
      >
      increase, she sees a throng of horsemen, where, escorted by Captain
      Delavan’s “West Chester Light Horse,” ride the heroes of that happy hour,
      General George Washington and Governor George Clinton. Dolly added her
      clear little treble to the loud huzzas as the famous commander-in-chief
      rode down the echoing street. Behind their excellencies came other
      officials, dignitaries, army officers, and files of citizens, on horseback
      and afoot, many of the latter returning to dismantled and ruined homes
      after nearly eight years of exile.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Dolly did not wait to see the whole procession. She had spied her
      father in the line of mounted citizens and flying across Queen Street, and
      around by Golden Hill (near Maiden Lane), where the first blood of the
      Revolution was spilled, she hurried down the Broad Way, so as to reach Mr.
      Cape’s tavern before their excellencies arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon she was in her father’s arms relating her adventures, and as she
      received his chidings for mingling in such “unseemly crowds,” and his
      praise for her championship and protection of the little Phillipse, a
      kindly hand was laid upon her fair young head, and a voice whose tones she
      could never forget said: “So may our children be angels of peace, Mr.
      Duane. Few have suffered more, or deserved better from their country, sir,
      than you; but the possession of so rare a little daughter is a fairer
      recompense than aught your country can bestow. Heaven has given me no
      children,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> sir; but had I
      thus been blessed, I could have wished for no gentler or truer-hearted
      little daughter than this maid of yours.” And with the stately courtesy
      that marked the time, General Washington bent down and kissed little Dolly
      as she sat on her father’s knee. Touched by his kindly words, Dolly forgot
      all her awe of the great man. Flinging two winsome arms about his neck,
      she kissed him in return, and said softly: “If Mr. Duane were not my
      father, sir, I would rather it should be you than any one else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In all her after-life, though she retained pleasant memories of Sir Guy
      Carleton, and thought him a grand and gallant gentleman, Dolly Duane held
      still more firmly to her reverence and affection for General Washington,
      whom she described as “looking more grand and noble than any human being
      she had ever seen.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Next to General Washington, I think she held the fireworks that were set
      off in the Bowling Green in honor of the Peace to have been the grandest
      thing she had ever seen. The rockets, and the wheels, and the
      tourbillions, and the batteries, and the stars were all so wonderful to
      her, that General Knox said Dolly’s “ohs” and “ahs” were “as good as a
      play”; and staid Master Clinton and jolly Cousin Ned threatened to send to
      the Ferry stairs for an anchor to hold her down. Both these young
      gentlemen grew to be famous Americans in after years, and witnessed many
      anniversaries of this glorious Evacuation Day. But they never<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_39"
        >[39]</span
      >
      enjoyed any of them quite as much as they did the exciting original, nor
      could they ever forget, amidst all the throng of memories, how sweet
      Mistress Dolly Duane championed and protected the lost “little lord of the
      manor,” and won the distinguished honor of being kissed by both the
      commanders-in-chief on the same eventful day.

      <p class="center"><span class="smcap">By NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        The Province House in Boston was the home of the Royal Governors of
        Massachusetts. This is the story of how the stately, spectre-haunted old
        Housekeeper, even after the departure of the last Royal Governor and the
        triumph of the Colonies, remained “faithful unto death” to her Sovereign
        Lord King George.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      THE hour had come—the hour of defeat and humiliation—when Sir William Howe
      was to pass over the threshold of the Province House, and embark, with no
      such triumphal ceremonies as he once promised himself, on board the
      British fleet. He bade his servants and military attendants go before him,
      and lingered a moment in the loneliness of the mansion, to quell the
      fierce emotions that struggled in his bosom as with a death-throb.
      Preferable, then, would he have deemed his fate had a warrior’s death left
      him a claim to the narrow territory of a grave within the soil which the
      king had given him to defend. With an ominous perception that, as his
      departing footsteps echoed adown the staircase, the sway of Britain was
      passing forever from New England, he smote his clinched hand on his brow,
      and cursed the destiny that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
      had flung the shame of a dismembered empire upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Would to God,” cried he, hardly repressing his tears of rage, “that the
      rebels were even now at the doorstep! A bloodstain upon the floor should
      then bear testimony that the last British ruler was faithful to his
      trust.”
    </p>
    <p>The tremulous voice of a woman replied to his exclamation.</p>
    <p>
      “Heaven’s cause and the King’s are one,” it said. “Go forth, Sir William
      Howe, and trust in Heaven to bring back a royal governor in triumph.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Subduing at once the passion to which he had yielded only in the faith
      that it was unwitnessed, Sir William Howe became conscious that an aged
      woman, leaning on a gold-headed staff, was standing betwixt him and the
      door. It was old Esther Dudley, who had dwelt almost immemorial years in
      this mansion, until her presence seemed as inseparable from it as the
      recollections of its history. She was the daughter of an ancient and once
      eminent family, which had fallen into poverty and decay, and left its last
      descendant no resource save the bounty of the king, nor any shelter except
      within the walls of the Province House. An office in the household, with
      merely nominal duties, had been assigned to her as a pretext for the
      payment of a small pension, the greater part of which she expended in
      adorning herself with an antique magnificence of attire. The claims of
      Esther Dudley’s gentle blood were acknowledged by all the successive
      governors;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> and they treated
      her with the punctilious courtesy which it was her foible to demand, not
      always with success, from a neglectful world. The only actual share which
      she assumed in the business of the mansion was to glide through its
      passages and public chambers, late at night, to see that the servants had
      dropped no fire from their flaring torches, nor left embers crackling and
      blazing on the hearths. Perhaps it was this invariable custom of walking
      her rounds in the hush of midnight that caused the superstition of the
      times to invest the old woman with attributes of awe and mystery; fabling
      that she had entered the portal of the Province House, none knew whence,
      in the train of the first royal governor, and that it was her fate to
      dwell there till the last should have departed. But Sir William Howe, if
      he ever heard this legend, had forgotten it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mistress Dudley, why are you loitering here?” asked he, with some
      severity of tone. “It is my pleasure to be the last in this mansion of the
      king.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Not so, if it please your Excellency,” answered the time-stricken woman.
      “This roof has sheltered me long. I will not pass from it until they bear
      me to the tomb of my forefathers. What other shelter is there for old
      Esther Dudley save the Province House or the grave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now Heaven forgive me!” said Sir William Howe to himself. “I was about to
      leave this wretched old creature to starve or beg. Take this, good
      Mistress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> Dudley,” he added,
      putting a purse into her hands. “King George’s head on these golden
      guineas is sterling yet, and will continue so, I warrant you, even should
      the rebels crown John Hancock their king. That purse will buy a better
      shelter than the Province House can now afford.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “While the burden of life remains upon me, I will have no other shelter
      than this roof,” persisted Esther Dudley, striking her staff upon the
      floor with a gesture that expressed immovable resolve. “And when your
      Excellency returns in triumph, I will totter into the porch to welcome
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My poor old friend!” answered the British General; and all his manly and
      martial pride could no longer restrain a gush of bitter tears. “This is an
      evil hour for you and me. The province which the king intrusted to my
      charge is lost. I go hence in misfortune—perchance in disgrace—to return
      no more. And you, whose present being is incorporated with the past—who
      have seen governor after governor, in stately pageantry, ascend these
      steps—whose whole life has been an observance of majestic ceremonies, and
      a worship of the king—how will you endure the change? Come with us! Bid
      farewell to a land that has shaken off its allegiance, and live still
      under a royal government, at Halifax.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never, never!” said the pertinacious old dame. “Here will I abide; and
      King George shall still have one true subject in his disloyal province.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“Beshrew the old fool!”
      muttered Sir William Howe, growing impatient of her obstinacy, and ashamed
      of the emotion into which he had been betrayed. “She is the very moral of
      old-fashioned prejudice, and could exist nowhere but in this musty
      edifice. Well, then, Mistress Dudley, since you will needs tarry, I give
      the Province House in charge to you. Take this key, and keep it safe until
      myself, or some other royal governor, shall demand it of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling bitterly at himself and her, he took the heavy key of the Province
      House, and, delivering it into the old lady’s hands, drew his cloak around
      him for departure. As the General glanced back at Esther Dudley’s antique
      figure, he deemed her well fitted for such a charge, as being so perfect a
      representative of the decayed past—of an age gone by, with its manners,
      opinions, faith, and feelings all fallen into oblivion or scorn—of what
      had once been a reality, but was now merely a vision of faded
      magnificence. Then Sir William Howe strode forth, smiting his clenched
      hands together in the fierce anguish of his spirit; and old Esther Dudley
      was left to keep watch in the lonely Province House, dwelling there with
      memory; and if Hope ever seemed to flit around her, still it was Memory in
      disguise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The total change of affairs that ensued on the departure of the British
      troops did not drive the venerable lady from her stronghold. There was
      not, for many years afterward, a governor of Massachusetts;<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_45"
        >[45]</span
      >
      and the magistrates, who had charge of such matters, saw no objection to
      Esther Dudley’s residence in the Province House, especially as they must
      otherwise have paid a hireling for taking care of the premises, which with
      her was a labor of love. And so they left her, the undisturbed mistress of
      the old historic edifice. Many and strange were the fables which the
      gossips whispered about her, in all the chimney-corners of the town. Among
      the time-worn articles of furniture that had been left in the mansion
      there was a tall, antique mirror, which was well worthy of a tale by
      itself, and perhaps may hereafter be the theme of one. The gold of its
      heavily wrought frame was tarnished, and its surface so blurred that the
      old woman’s figure, whenever she paused before it, looked indistinct and
      ghostlike. But it was the general belief that Esther could cause the
      governors of the overthrown dynasty, with the beautiful ladies who had
      once adorned their festivals, the Indian chiefs who had come up to the
      Province House to hold council or swear allegiance, the grim, provincial
      warriors, the severe clergymen—in short, all the pageantry of gone
      days—all the figures that ever swept across the broad plate of glass in
      former times—she could cause the whole to reappear, and people the inner
      world of the mirror with shadows of old life. Such legends as these,
      together with the singularity of her isolated existence, her age, and the
      infirmity that each added winter flung upon her, made Mistress Dudley the
      object both of fear and pity; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46"
        >[46]</span
      >
      it was partly the result of either sentiment that, amid all the angry
      license of the times, neither wrong nor insult ever fell upon her
      unprotected head. Indeed, there was so much haughtiness in her demeanor
      toward intruders, among whom she reckoned all persons acting under the new
      authorities, that it was really an affair of no small nerve to look her in
      the face. And to do the people justice, stern republicans as they had now
      become, they were well content that the old gentlewoman, in her hoop
      petticoat and faded embroidery, should still haunt the palace of ruined
      pride and overthrown power, the symbol of a departed system, embodying a
      history in her person. So Esther Dudley dwelt, year after year, in the
      Province House, still reverencing all that others had flung aside, still
      faithful to her king, who, so long as the venerable dame yet held her
      post, might be said to retain one true subject in New England, and one
      spot of the empire that had been wrested from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And did she dwell there in utter loneliness? Rumor said, not so. Whenever
      her chill and withered heart desired warmth, she was wont to summon a
      black slave of Governor Shirley’s from the blurred mirror, and send him in
      search of guests who had long ago been familiar in those deserted
      chambers. Forth went the sable messenger, with the starlight or the
      moonshine gleaming through him, and did his errand in the burial-ground,
      knocking at the iron doors of tombs, or upon the marble slabs that covered
      them, and whispering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> to
      those within, “My mistress, old Esther Dudley, bids you to the Province
      House at midnight.” And punctually as the clock of the Old South told
      twelve came the shadows of the Olivers, the Hutchinsons, the Dudleys, all
      the grandees of a bygone generation, gliding beneath the portal into the
      well-known mansion, where Esther mingled with them as if she likewise were
      a shade. Without vouching for the truth of such traditions, it is certain
      that Mistress Dudley sometimes assembled a few of the stanch though
      crestfallen old Tories who had lingered in the rebel town during those
      days of wrath and tribulation. Out of a cobwebbed bottle, containing
      liquor that a royal governor might have smacked his lips over, they
      quaffed healths to the king, and babbled treason to the Republic, feeling
      as if the protecting shadow of the throne were still flung around them.
      But, draining the last drops of their liquor, they stole timorously
      homeward, and answered not again if the rude mob reviled them in the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Esther Dudley’s most frequent and favored guests were the children of
      the town. Toward them she was never stern. A kindly and loving nature,
      hindered elsewhere from its free course by a thousand rocky prejudices,
      lavished itself upon these little ones. By bribes of gingerbread of her
      own making, stamped with a royal crown, she tempted their sunny
      sportiveness beneath the gloomy portal of the Province House, and would
      often beguile them to spend a whole play-day there, sitting in a circle
      round the verge of her hoop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
      petticoat, greedily attentive to her stories of a dead world. And when
      these little boys and girls stole forth again from the dark, mysterious
      mansion, they went bewildered, full of old feelings that graver people had
      long ago forgotten, rubbing their eyes at the world around them as if they
      had gone astray into ancient times, and become children of the past. At
      home, when their parents asked where they had loitered such a weary while,
      and with whom they had been at play, the children would talk of all the
      departed worthies of the province, as far back as Governor Belcher, and
      the haughty dame of Sir William Phipps. It would seem as though they had
      been sitting on the knees of these famous personages, whom the grave had
      hidden for half a century, and had toyed with the embroidery of their rich
      waistcoats, or roguishly pulled the long curls of their flowing wigs. “But
      Governor Belcher has been dead this many a year,” would the mother say to
      her little boy. “And did you really see him at the Province House?” “Oh,
      yes, dear mother! Yes!” the half-dreaming child would answer. “But when
      old Esther had done speaking about him he faded away out of his chair.”
      Thus, without affrighting her little guests, she led them by the hand into
      the chambers of her own desolate heart, and made childhood’s fancy discern
      the ghosts that haunted there.

      mind by a proper reference to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49"
        >[49]</span
      >
      present things, Esther Dudley appears to have grown partially crazed. It
      was found that she had no right sense of the progress and true state of
      the Revolutionary War, but held a constant faith that the armies of
      Britain were victorious on every field, and destined to be ultimately
      triumphant. Whenever the town rejoiced for a battle won by Washington, or
      Gates, or Morgan, or Greene, the news, in passing through the door of the
      Province House, as through the ivory gate of dreams, became metamorphosed
      into a strange tale of the prowess of Howe, Clinton, or Cornwallis. Sooner
      or later, it was her invincible belief, the colonies would be prostrate at
      the footstool of the king. Sometimes she seemed to take for granted that
      such was already the case. On one occasion she startled the townspeople by
      a brilliant illumination of the Province House, with candles at every pane
      of glass, and a transparency of the king’s initials and a crown of light
      in the great balcony window. The figure of the aged woman, in the most
      gorgeous of her mildewed velvets and brocades, was seen passing from
      casement to casement, until she paused before the balcony, and flourished
      a huge key above her head. Her wrinkled visage actually gleamed with
      triumph, as if the soul within her were a festal lamp.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What means this blaze of light? What does old Esther’s joy portend?”
      whispered a spectator. “It is frightful to see her gliding about the
      chambers, and rejoicing there without a soul to bear her company.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“It is as if she were making
      merry in a tomb,” said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pshaw! It is no such mystery,” observed an old man, after some brief
      exercise of memory. “Mistress Dudley is keeping jubilee for the King of
      England’s birthday.” Then the people laughed aloud, and would have thrown
      mud against the blazing transparency of the king’s crown and initials,
      only that they pitied the poor old dame, who was so dismally triumphant
      amid the wreck and ruin of the system to which she appertained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oftentimes it was her custom to climb the weary staircase that wound
      upward to the cupola, and thence strain her dimmed eyesight seaward and
      countryward, watching for a British fleet, or for the march of a grand
      procession, with the king’s banner floating over it. The passengers in the
      street below would discern her anxious visage, and send up a shout, “When
      the golden Indian on the Province House shall shoot his arrow, and when
      the cock on the Old South spire shall crow, then look for a royal governor
      again!”—for this had grown a byword through the town. And at last, after
      long, long years, old Esther Dudley knew, or perchance she only dreamed,
      that a royal governor was on the eve of returning to the Province House,
      to receive the heavy key which Sir William Howe had committed to her
      charge. Now it was the fact that intelligence bearing some faint analogy
      to Esther’s version of it was current among the townspeople. She set the
      mansion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> in the best order
      that her means allowed, and, arraying herself in silks and tarnished gold,
      stood long before the blurred mirror to admire her own magnificence. As
      she gazed, the gray and withered lady moved her ashen lips, murmuring half
      aloud, talking to shapes that she saw within the mirror, to shadows of her
      own fantasies, to the household friends of memory, and bidding them
      rejoice with her, and come forth to meet the governor. And, while absorbed
      in this communion, Mistress Dudley heard the tramp of many footsteps in
      the street, and, looking out at the window, beheld what she construed as
      the royal governor’s arrival.
    </p>
    <p>
      “O happy day! O blessed, blessed hour!” she exclaimed. “Let me but bid him
      welcome within the portal, and my task in the Province House, and on
      earth, is done!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then with tottering feet, which age and tremulous joy caused to tread
      amiss, she hurried down the grand staircase, her silks sweeping and
      rustling as she went, so that the sound was as if a train of spectral
      courtiers were thronging from the dim mirror. And Esther Dudley fancied
      that, as soon as the wide door should be flung open, all the pomp and
      splendor of bygone times would pace majestically into the Province House,
      and the gilded tapestry of the past would be brightened by the sunshine of
      the present. She turned the key, withdrew it from the lock, unclosed the
      door, and stepped across the threshold. Advancing up the courtyard
      appeared a person of most dignified mien,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_52"
        >[52]</span
      >
      with tokens, as Esther interpreted them, of gentle blood, high rank, and
      long-accustomed authority, even in his walk and every gesture. He was
      richly dressed, but wore a gouty shoe, which, however, did not lessen the
      stateliness of his gait. Around and behind him were people in plain civic
      dresses, and two or three war-worn veterans, evidently officers of rank,
      arrayed in a uniform of blue and buff. But Esther Dudley, firm in the
      belief that had fastened its roots about her heart, beheld only the
      principal personage, and never doubted that this was the long-looked-for
      governor, to whom she was to surrender up her charge. As he approached,
      she involuntarily sank down on her knees, and tremblingly held forth the
      heavy key.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Receive my trust! take it quickly!” cried she; “for methinks Death is
      striving to snatch away my triumph. But he comes too late. Thank Heaven
      for this blessed hour! God save King George!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That, madam, is a strange prayer to be offered up at such a moment,”
      replied the unknown guest of the Province House, and, courteously removing
      his hat, he offered his arm to raise the aged woman. “Yet, in reverence
      for your gray hairs and long-kept faith, Heaven forbid that any here
      should say you nay. Over the realms which still acknowledge his sceptre,
      God save King George!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Esther Dudley started to her feet, and, hastily clutching back the key,
      gazed with fearful earnestness at the stranger; and dimly and doubtfully,
      as if suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> awakened from
      a dream, her bewildered eyes half recognized his face. Years ago she had
      known him among the gentry of the province. But the ban of the king had
      fallen upon him! How, then, came the doomed victim here? Proscribed,
      excluded from mercy, the monarch’s most dreaded and hated foe, this New
      England merchant had stood triumphantly against a kingdom’s strength; and
      his foot now trod upon humbled royalty as he ascended the steps of the
      Province House, the people’s chosen governor of Massachusetts.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Wretch, wretch that I am!” muttered the old woman, with such a
      heart-broken expression that the tears gushed from the stranger’s eyes.
      “Have I bidden a traitor welcome? Come, Death! come quickly!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Alas, venerable lady!” said Governor Hancock, lending her his support
      with all the reverence that a courtier would have shown to a queen. “Your
      life has been prolonged until the world has changed around you. You have
      treasured up all that time has rendered worthless—the principles,
      feelings, manners, modes of being and acting, which another generation has
      flung aside—and you are a symbol of the past. And I, and these around
      me—we represent a new race of men—living no longer in the past, scarcely
      in the present—but projecting our lives forward into the future. Ceasing
      to model ourselves on ancestral superstitions, it is our faith and
      principle to press onward, onward! Yet,” continued he, turning to his
      attendants,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> “let us
      reverence, for the last time, the stately and gorgeous prejudices of the
      tottering Past!”
    </p>
    <p>
      While the republican governor spoke he had continued to support the
      helpless form of Esther Dudley; her weight grew heavier against his arm;
      but at last, with a sudden effort to free herself, the ancient woman sank
      down beside one of the pillars of the portal. The key of the Province
      House fell from her grasp, and clanked against the stone.
    </p>
    <p>“I have been faithful unto death,” murmured she. “God save the king!”</p>
    <p>
      “She hath done her office!” said Hancock solemnly. “We will follow her
      reverently to the tomb of her ancestors; and then, my fellow-citizens,
      onward, onward! We are no longer children of the Past!”

        The story of a brave little Quaker girl’s perilous ride. How she saved
        the lives of many hard-pressed patriots, and won praise from the lips of
        General Washington, himself.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      THE sun was just rising and showering his first rays on the gambrel roof
      and solid stone walls of a house surrounded by a magnificent grove of
      walnuts, and overlooking one of the beautiful valleys so common in
      southeastern Pennsylvania. Close by the house, and shaded by the same
      great trees, stood a low building of the most severe type, whose
      time-stained bricks and timbers green with moss told its age without the
      aid of the half-obliterated inscription over the door, which read, “Built
      A. D. 1720.” One familiar with the country would have pronounced it
      without hesitation a Quaker meeting-house, dating back almost to the time
      of William Penn.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Ezra Dale had become the leader of the little band of Quakers which
      gathered here every First Day, he had built the house under the walnut
      trees, and had taken his wife Ann and his little daughter Betty to live
      there. That was in 1770, seven years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56"
        >[56]</span
      >
      earlier, and before war had wrought sorrow and desolation throughout the
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun rose higher, and just as his beams touched the broad stone step in
      front of the house, the door opened, and Ann Dale, a sweet-faced woman in
      the plain Quaker garb, came out, followed by Betty, a little blue-eyed
      Quakeress of twelve years, with a gleam of spirit in her face which ill
      became her plain dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Betty,” said her mother, as they walked out toward the great horse block
      by the roadside, “thee must keep house to-day. Friend Robert has just sent
      thy father word that the redcoats have not crossed the Brandywine since
      Third Day last, and thy father and I will ride to Chester to-day, that
      there may be other than corn-cakes and bacon for the friends who come to
      us after monthly meeting. Mind thee keeps near the house and finishes thy
      sampler.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, mother,” said Betty; “but will thee not come home early? I shall
      miss thee sadly.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then Ezra appeared, wearing his collarless Quaker coat, and leading a
      horse saddled with a great pillion, into which Ann laboriously climbed
      after her husband, and with a final warning and “farewell” to Betty,
      clasped him tightly around the waist lest she should be jolted off as they
      jogged down the rough and winding lane into the broad Chester highway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Friend Ann had many reasons for fearing to leave Betty alone for a whole
      day, and she looked back<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
      anxiously at her waving “farewell” with her little bonnet.
    </p>
    <p>It was a troublous time.</p>
    <p>
      The Revolution was at its height, and the British, who had a short time
      before disembarked their army near Elkton, Maryland, were now encamped
      near White Clay Creek, while Washington occupied the country bordering on
      the Brandywine. His force, however, was small compared to the extent of
      the country to be guarded, and bands of the British sometimes crossed the
      Brandywine and foraged in the fertile counties of Delaware and Chester. As
      Betty’s father, although a Quaker and a non-combatant, was known to be a
      patriot, he had to suffer the fortunes of war with his neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was with many forebodings that Betty’s mother watched the slight
      figure under the spreading branches of a great chestnut, which seemed to
      rustle its innumerable leaves as if to promise protection to the little
      maid. However, the sun shone brightly, the swallows chirped as they
      circled overhead, and nothing seemed farther off than battle and
      bloodshed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty skipped merrily into the house, and snatching up some broken
      corn-cake left from the morning meal, ran lightly out to the paddock where
      Daisy was kept, her own horse, which she had helped to raise from a colt.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come thee here, Daisy,” she said, as she seated herself on the top rail
      of the mossy snake fence. “Come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58"
        >[58]</span
      >
      thee here, and thee shall have some of thy mistress’s corn-cake. Ah! I
      thought thee would like it. Now go and eat all thee can of this good
      grass, for if the wicked redcoats come again, thee will not have another
      chance, I can tell thee.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Daisy whinnied and trotted off, while Betty, feeding the few chickens
      (sadly reduced in numbers by numerous raids), returned to the house, and
      getting her sampler, sat down under a walnut tree to sew on the stint
      which her mother had given her.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was quiet save the chattering of the squirrels overhead and the drowsy
      hum of the bees, when from around the curve in the road she heard a shot;
      then another nearer, and then a voice shouting commands, and the thud of
      hoof-beats farther down the valley. She jumped up with a startled cry:
      “The redcoats! The redcoats! Oh, what shall I do!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then the foremost of a scattered band of soldiers, their buff and
      blue uniforms and ill-assorted arms showing them to be Americans, appeared
      in full flight around the curve in the road, and springing over the fence,
      dashed across the pasture straight for the meeting-house. Through the
      broad gateway they poured, and forcing open the door of the meeting-house,
      rushed within and began to barricade the windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their leader paused while his men passed in, and seeing Betty, came
      quickly toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What do you here, child?” he said hurriedly. “Go quickly, before the
      British reach us, and tell your father,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59"
        >[59]</span
      >
      that, Quaker or no Quaker, he shall ride to Washington, on the Brandywine,
      and tell him that we, but one hundred men, are besieged by three hundred
      British cavalry in Chichester meeting-house, with but little powder left.
      Tell him to make all haste to us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning, he hastened into the meeting-house, now converted into a fort,
      and as the doors closed behind him Betty saw a black muzzle protruding
      from every window.
    </p>
    <p>
      With trembling fingers the little maid picked up her sampler, and as the
      thud of horses’ hoofs grew louder and louder, she ran fearfully into the
      house, locked and bolted the massive door, and then flying up the broad
      stairs, she seated herself in a little window overlooking the
      meeting-house yard. She had gone into the house none too soon. Up the
      road, with their red coats gleaming and their harness jangling, was
      sweeping a detachment of British cavalry, never stopping until they
      reached the meeting-house—and then it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sheet of flame shot out from the wall before them, and half a dozen
      troopers fell lifeless to the ground, and half a dozen riderless horses
      galloped wildly down the road. The leader shouted a sharp command, and the
      whole troop retreated in confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty drew back shuddering, and when she brought herself to look again the
      troopers had dismounted, had surrounded the meeting-house, and were
      pouring volley after volley at its doors and windows. Then for the first
      time Betty thought of the officer’s message, and<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_60"
        >[60]</span
      >
      remembered that the safety of the Americans depended upon her alone, for
      her father was away, no neighbor within reach, and without powder she knew
      they could not resist long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could she save them? All her stern Quaker blood rose at the thought, and
      stealing softly to the paddock behind the barn, she saddled Daisy and led
      her through the bars into the wood road, which opened into the highway
      just around the bend. Could she but pass the pickets without discovery
      there would be little danger of pursuit; then there would be only the long
      ride of eight miles ahead of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the narrow wood road joined the broader highway Betty mounted
      Daisy by means of a convenient stump, and starting off at a gallop, had
      just turned the corner when a voice shouted “Halt” and a shot whistled
      past her head. Betty screamed with terror, and bending over, brought down
      her riding whip with all her strength upon Daisy, then, turning for a
      moment, saw three troopers hurriedly mounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her heart sank within her, but, beginning to feel the excitement of the
      chase, she leaned over and patting Daisy on the neck, encouraged her to do
      her best. Onward they sped. Betty, her curly hair streaming in the wind,
      the color now mounting to, now retreating from, her cheeks, led by five
      hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Daisy had not been used for weeks, and already felt the unusual
      strain. Now they thundered over Naaman’s Creek, now over Concord, with the
      nearest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> pursuer only four
      hundred yards behind; and now they raced beside the clear waters of Beaver
      Brook, and as Betty dashed through its shallow ford, the thud of horses’
      hoofs seemed just over her shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, at first sure of success, now knew that unless in some way she
      could throw her pursuers off her track she was surely lost. Just then she
      saw ahead of her a fork in the road, the lower branch leading to the
      Brandywine, the upper to the Birmingham Meeting-house. Could she but get
      the troopers on the upper road while she took the lower, she would be
      safe; and, as if in answer to her wish, there flashed across her mind the
      remembrance of the old cross-road which, long disused, and with its
      entrance hidden by drooping boughs, led from a point in the upper road
      just out of sight of the fork down across the lower, and through the
      valley of the Brandywine. Could she gain this road unseen she still might
      reach Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Urging Daisy forward, she broke just in time through the dense growth
      which hid the entrance, and sat trembling, hidden behind a dense growth of
      tangled vines, while she heard the troopers thunder by. Then, riding
      through the rustling woods, she came at last into the open, and saw spread
      out beneath her the beautiful valley of the Brandywine dotted with the
      white tents of the Continental army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Starting off at a gallop, she dashed around a bend in the road into the
      midst of a group of officers riding slowly up from the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>“Stop, little maiden, before
      you run us down,” said one, who seemed to be in command. “Where are you
      going in such hot haste?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, sir,” said Betty, reining in Daisy, “can thee tell me where I can
      find General Washington?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, little Quakeress,” said the officer, who had first spoken to her, “I
      am he. What do you wish?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Betty, too exhausted to be surprised, poured forth her story in a few
      broken sentences, and (hearing as if in a dream the hasty commands for the
      rescue of the soldiers in Chichester Meeting-house) fell forward in her
      saddle, and, for the first time in her life, fainted, worn out by her
      noble ride.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, when recovering from the shock of her long and eventful
      ride, Betty, waking from a deep sleep, found her mother kneeling beside
      her little bed, while her father talked with General Washington himself
      beside the fireplace; and it was the proudest and happiest moment of her
      life when Washington, coming forward and taking her by the hand, said,
      “You are the bravest little maid in America, and an honor to your
      country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the peaceful meeting-house and the gambrel-roofed home stand
      unchanged, save that their time-beaten timbers and crumbling bricks have
      taken on a more sombre tinge, and under the broad walnut tree another
      little Betty sits and sews.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you ask it, she will take down the great key from its nail, and
      swinging back the new doors of the meeting-house,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_63"
        >[63]</span

        Two little New Hampshire boys play a part in the patriots’ capture of a
        quantity of King George’s powder, and this very same powder was
        afterward used to fight the redcoats at the Battle of Bunker Hill.

    <p class="drop-cap">
      TONY sat on a bench in the corner of the great stone fireplace watching
      the big logs as they sang and crackled and the flames leaped upward
      filling the room with a cheerful glow. Now and then he turned his head and
      glanced at a tall woman who was bustling about, getting supper ready.
    </p>
    <p>“Aunt Mercy?”</p>
    <p>No answer.</p>
    <p>“Aunt Mercy,” he said, a little louder.</p>
    <p>
      But his aunt did not reply. She probably did not hear the boy so occupied
      was she with her thoughts. Her usually pleasant face wore an anxious look
      and several times Tony fancied from the movements of her lips that she was
      speaking to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, dear!” he thought. “I wonder what it is that has made Aunt Mercy so
      sober for the last day or two!<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65"
        >[65]</span
      >
      She doesn’t answer me when I speak. She hardly notices Larry and me, and
      it’s just the same with Uncle Eben. They whisper together, and some of the
      neighbors have been here, and they have all been shut up in a room
      together, and they all look so solemn! I only hope that dreadful war isn’t
      going to come that they talk about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tony,” said his aunt, as she took two shining pewter platters from the
      dresser and placed them on the table, “have you or Larry come across my
      spectacles anywhere?”
    </p>
    <p>“No, ma’am.”</p>
    <p>
      “Well, perhaps I left them at meeting last Sunday. Never mind. I want you
      to go up garret and bring me that big bunch of herbs hanging by the east
      window.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony glanced toward the kitchen window and was relieved to find it was
      still quite light. He was always shy of the old, open garret even in the
      daytime. He never liked to play there as well as his brother Larry and the
      other boys. The long rows of cloaks and coats and gowns swinging from
      their pegs in the dimly lighted space under the rafters had a look that
      made him feel as if they might spring out at him as he passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there were certain other things there which helped to increase Tony’s
      dread of the garret. There were an old chest in the corner containing the
      uniform of Tony’s great uncle who had served as captain in the early
      French and Indian wars, and a rusty sword and tomahawk hanging from a nail
      in the huge beam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> overhead.
      The sword had two or three suggestive notches in the long blade, and on
      the wooden handle of the tomahawk which had once belonged to a ferocious
      Indian chief were several suspicious-looking brown stains. Larry liked to
      handle these relics, but the mere sight of them always sent shivers
      creeping down Tony’s back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Make haste, Tony, and bring the herbs before it grows any darker,”
      continued his aunt. “I never like to go up garret with a light; it’s
      dangerous business. I am worried and nervous, and I want a bowl of hot
      herb tea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony stopped, his thumb on the latch. “What is it that worries you so?” he
      asked in his sweet, sympathetic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A thousand things, child, you wouldn’t understand if I told you—the dread
      of what’s coming—the loss of property and friends—life itself perhaps. But
      we’ll hope for the best. The king may yet repent and try to do what is
      right by us. But we don’t know—we don’t know.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the December of 1774, five months before Lexington, the first
      battle of the American Revolution. Throughout the colonies there was a
      growing feeling of uneasiness and indignation. The colonists were too much
      attached to the mother country to wish for war. Morning and night they
      prayed that God would show them some peaceful way out of the trouble. But
      the king had taken away so many of their rights and laid<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_67"
        >[67]</span
      >
      taxes so heavy and unjust upon them that it began to look as if the only
      thing to do was to fight him. The people of New Hampshire, where Larry and
      Tony lived, were especially excited and alarmed, for they were so near
      Boston that they sympathized heartily with that much-wronged city which
      seemed to have been singled out as a mark for special spite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony passed through the cold hall and upstairs, and opening the garret
      door stumbled hastily to the top step. As he reached the landing his heart
      gave a sudden thump. He fancied he heard a noise. He stood listening, but
      there was not a sound. “I guess it was the branches of the big elm
      scraping against the roof,” he thought. Mustering his courage he darted by
      the row of clothes and was just reaching up for the herbs when a figure
      suddenly stepped from behind the chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” gasped the frightened boy, stumbling back over the big chest and
      bumping his head with a clatter against the dreaded sword and tomahawk.
      Larry’s arm raised him to his feet and Larry’s bright face bent over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, Tony! how little it takes to scare you! I was up here and heard some
      one coming and thought it one of the men and that I’d have some fun with
      him. See!” and Larry took down the rusty tomahawk and gave a whoop that
      made the rafters ring, and flourished the old relic in a way that caused
      Tony’s curly hair to stand on end. “This isn’t such a terrible thing,
      after all—it can’t hurt you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>He got the herbs for his
      young brother and as he did so, happened to look out of the window.
      “Whew!” he whistled softly, “there are two men going into the
      meeting-house. And how queerly they act, looking all around as if they
      were afraid some one would see them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, Larry! can’t you run up and see if Aunt Mercy’s spectacles are in the
      pew? She thinks she left them there last Sunday.”
    </p>
    <p>“All right! you take the herbs downstairs and I will.”</p>
    <p>
      On his return to the kitchen Tony found that his aunt had left the room,
      and he sat down in the chimney corner to wait for supper. In a few moments
      the door opened, and Larry stood before him, his eyes flashing, his cheeks
      flushed.
    </p>
    <p>“Did you get the spectacles, Larry?”</p>
    <p>
      “Spectacles! I haven’t even thought of them. Listen, Tony! I have a
      secret—a <i>great</i> secret. After I left you I hurried up to the
      meeting-house and as I stepped inside the entry I thought I heard a queer
      noise, as if some one were digging. So I opened the door softly and peeped
      in—and there—<i
        >as sure as you are alive, I saw two men digging a great, deep hole
        under the pulpit</i
      >. They were talking so low I couldn’t hear more than half they said. But
      I made out that uncle and Captain Sullivan and some others are going to
      meet there to-night and go off in boats on some wonderful expedition. And,
      Tony, I am going to find out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
      what it is. We’ll go to our room as usual after supper, but instead of
      going to bed, we’ll creep downstairs and go up to the meeting-house and
      hide inside, and wait there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But will it be right to listen, Larry?” asked Tony gravely. “You know
      Aunt Mercy says ‘Eavesdroppers hear no good of themselves.’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But this isn’t eavesdropping, Tony. Listening is a mean trick. But this
      is different. Uncle is going into danger of some sort and I
      <i>ought</i> to learn what it is. I can’t believe <i>that</i> is wrong.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony finally consented, thinking he would rather watch with Larry in the
      church than stay in his room at home alone in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Aunt Mercy returned, she filled the big iron pot with water, hung it
      on the crane and swung it over the blazing logs. “We are going to have
      pudding and milk for supper,” she said, “and we won’t wait for your uncle;
      he’s away, and may not be back until late into the night.”
    </p>
    <p>
      At these words Larry glanced significantly at Tony and gave a wise little
      nod.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      With the going down of the sun the cold rapidly increased. The night was
      clear and frosty. In front of the little wooden meeting-house on Durham
      Hill stood the two brothers shivering with cold and excitement. “Whew!”
      exclaimed Larry, pulling his cap down over his ears, “it’s a sharp night,
      Tony.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span> Come farther this way;
      the meeting-house will keep off the wind.”
    </p>
    <p>“Shall we have to wait long, Larry?” asked Tony.</p>
    <p>
      Larry glanced at the moon just rising above the treetops. “I think it’s
      past the time now. Oh, I wonder what it is they are going to do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “P’raps they are going to cross the ocean and take the king prisoner. I
      don’t think he treats us very well nowadays,” said Tony plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Larry laughed. “I guess they won’t go quite as far as that. Oh, Tony! if I
      were a man, they would take me. It’s so provoking to be only a boy. I’m
      just big enough to want to be of some use, but not old enough to be
      trusted.” He drew Tony back in the shelter of the church and waited with
      his eyes fixed on the flowing Piscataqua which swept around the base of
      the hill on which they stood, and at the next turn widened into the broad
      expanse known as “The Great Bay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was upon the banks of this river that some of the bloodiest scenes of
      the early Indian wars had been enacted. Again and again had its shores
      resounded with warwhoops as the red men under cover of night rowed their
      canoes up to the infant settlements of New Hampshire and spared neither
      man, woman, nor child in the slaughter which followed. Across the river,
      in full view of the meeting-house, was a log fort known as the “Old Block
      House” which had served on many occasions as a refuge for the early
      settlers and enabled them to keep their savage foes at bay.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>“It’s cold—and—lonesome out
      here,” said Tony with a shiver, glancing involuntarily at the “Block
      House.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You don’t mean to say you’re afraid of the Block House, Tony! Why, you
      are always glad of a chance to play there, afternoons.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes—but that was in the daytime. Out here in the dark I don’t like to
      think of the people who have been killed there.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tony! If we come to blows with England you won’t make a very good
      soldier. Now I’d like no better fun than to be in the Block House with a
      lot of screeching Indians outside. But we mustn’t talk so loud—and
      remember—if we hear the least noise we are to scamper into the
      meeting-house and hide.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon climbed higher and higher in the heavens, and soon there came to
      the ears of the watchers by the church the plash of oars. Larry bent
      forward, and his keen eyes detected a small black speck on the surface of
      the river. At the same time the sound of rapid footsteps was heard, and
      the two boys hastily entered the church and stumbling through the dark
      entry felt their way along the aisle and crouched down in one of the pews.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meantime, a man closely wrapped in a military cloak had taken their place
      in front of the church and stood looking out on the water. He, too, saw
      the dark object. Raising his fingers to his lips he gave a shrill whistle,
      which was promptly answered from the river, and in a<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_72"
        >[72]</span
      >
      short time eleven men, armed with muskets, came creeping stealthily up the
      hill, single file.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are late, Captain Sullivan,” called out a gay voice, “but His Majesty
      has several devoted subjects hereabouts, and we did not dare venture
      within range of their prying eyes until after dark.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Peace, Scammel, or that merry voice of yours will be starting some of
      these same good folks from their firesides,” returned Sullivan. “My trusty
      men!” there was a triumphant ring in his voice as he greeted them each by
      name—“Captain Winborn Adams, Eleazer Bennett, Ebenezer Thompson, John
      Demeritt, Alpheus Chesley, Jonathan Chesley, John Spenser, Micah Davis,
      Isaac Small, Benjamin Small, Alexander Scammel—thank God! not one of you
      is missing. And now, is everything ready yonder?” He pointed to the
      church.
    </p>
    <p>
      “See for yourself, Captain,” answered one of the men; and opening the door
      he paused to light a lantern which stood in the little entry. The eleven
      men followed him, their heavy boots clattering on the bare floor—down the
      aisle, to the pulpit. Here he stopped, and held the lantern high above his
      head. By the dim light they saw the deep pit, the loosened boards, and the
      pile of earth standing ready for filling in again.
    </p>
    <p>
      “’Tis well planned,” said the Captain, nodding approvingly. “It is the
      last place the British will think of searching for their lost powder. When
      Paul Revere came riding in hot haste into Portsmouth town last<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_73"
        >[73]</span
      >
      night, bearing despatches from the Massachusetts Committee of Safety
      saying the king had ordered the seizure of all the powder and arms in the
      provinces, and that two of Gage’s regiments were on their way to garrison
      Portsmouth and Fort William and Mary here in Piscataqua harbor, I made up
      my mind that what was done must be done quickly. For if England forces us
      to fight—and it looks that way now—’twere well to have something to fight
      with.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In good sooth, Captain Sullivan,” returned Scammel, “we should have to
      fight with the butt-end of our muskets, for powder and bullets are as
      scarce as roses at Christmas.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan continued: “I made up my mind that if I could get a few trusty
      men to join me I would make a dash for the fort on my own responsibility,
      for the possession of that powder means <i>everything</i> to us. But I do
      not want one of you to stir a foot unless you have counted the cost. This
      is a deliberate assault on a royal fortress, and it exposes every one of
      us to the penalty for high treason. If any man shrinks, let him turn back
      now before it is too late.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have counted the cost,” answered John Demeritt, “and we are ready.”
    </p>
    <p>“Follow me, then,” cried Sullivan, “and may God speed the right!”</p>
    <p>
      At that instant Tony, who was doubled up under the seat like a jackknife,
      had a cramp in his leg, and in trying to move his foot hit a wooden
      stool—and over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> it went with
      a loud crash, causing the utmost confusion. The men began searching the
      church while Larry’s uncle rushed around shouting savagely: “A spy! A spy!
      Seize him! Take him, dead or alive!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It’s only us—Larry and me,” piped Tony, frightened almost out of his wits
      by his uncle’s fury. “We wanted to find out what was going on. And won’t
      you please take Larry with you? He is so brave and wants to fight so
      much.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Go home, boys, and to bed, both of you!” ordered Larry’s uncle. “I’ll
      settle with you for this to-morrow. Do not look so disturbed, Captain
      Sullivan—I’ll answer for their secrecy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, uncle! Oh, Captain Sullivan!” begged Larry in an eager, excited tone,
      “do let me go. I know I can help in some way. I want to be of some use,
      and I’m not afraid any more than you are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan was touched by the boy’s earnestness. “We cannot take you, my
      boy. It would not be prudent—but you can help if you really wish it—there
      <i>is</i> a way.” He turned and whispered with some of the men. “We may
      need a pair of oxen to cart the powder. We ought not to bury it all in one
      place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If the lad will have the oxen and some straw ready for us in yonder barn,
      I’ll cart the powder wherever you say,” said John Demeritt. “I’ll bury it
      in my own cellar if you can think of no better place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sullivan noted the disappointment in Larry’s answer. “We are trusting much
      to you, my boy,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span> said
      gravely; “and remember, Larry, if you want to be a soldier you must first
      learn to <i>obey</i>. Now go take your little brother home, and then have
      the team ready for us by the time yonder bright star reaches that line of
      woods by the Block House.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boys left, the men quickened their pace almost to a run in order
      to keep up with the Captain as he strode down-hill to the “gondola.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Gondola” was the name given by the colonists to the broad, flat-bottomed
      scows used on the Piscataqua in the transportation of stone and other
      heavy material.
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of the little party quietly took the places assigned them, and
      the scow swung off into the middle of the river and moved slowly
      down-stream. The only sounds to be heard were the moaning of the wind
      through the bare forests and the measured dip of oars. The trip was made
      for the most part in silence, the men bending eagerly over the oars too
      much engrossed with their thoughts to indulge in idle chat. As the scow
      approached Portsmouth and the lights of the town glimmered in the
      distance, Sullivan ordered the men to row slowly.
    </p>
    <p>“If discovered now,” said he, “all is lost.”</p>
    <p>
      In a few moments they rounded a little headland and found awaiting them in
      the cove beyond two gondolas and a small boat containing in all some
      eighteen men. These were under the leadership of Captain Pickering.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let us be off!” exclaimed Sullivan impatiently.<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_76"
        >[76]</span
      >
      “We must cross Portsmouth harbor before the moon shows her face again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They pulled out into the middle of the stream in the momentary darkness,
      and by the time the clouds had drifted away from the moon the little fleet
      was within a rod of the island on which stood Fort William and Mary. All
      was dark and still within, and the only sound outside was the wash of the
      waves on the narrow beach. After a whispered consultation the men
      disembarked at a signal from Sullivan. Wading through the icy water they
      arranged themselves in line at the rear of the fort, while Pickering with
      three others crept cautiously in the shadow of the wall and disappeared
      behind one of the bastions. In a moment more a sentinel’s challenge rang
      out sharp and clear: “Who goes there? Stand, and give the countersign!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pickering seized the soldier’s gun and grasped him by the throat. “Not a
      word more or you are a dead man,” he whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men then made their way to the commandant’s room. He looked up as
      Sullivan and Pickering entered, but his smile of recognition changed to a
      blank stare as the former said with much agitation: “Captain Cochran, you
      are our prisoner. Your little garrison has surrendered. You had better
      follow its example!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Cochran glanced at the resolute faces of his captors, then tendered his
      sword. He was left in charge of two of the men while the rest of the party
      proceeded to break open the magazine. In the course of an hour and<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_77"
        >[77]</span
      >
      a half the powder was safe in the gondolas and the little band left the
      fort and began the hard task of rowing up-stream. Absolute silence was
      maintained, and when they finally landed at the foot of meeting-house hill
      and found Larry with the oxen awaiting them, they took off their heavy,
      nailed shoes lest a spark from them should set fire to the powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      By dawn Larry was back in his room telling the wonderful story to Tony.
      One half of the king’s powder was buried deep beneath the pulpit of the
      meeting-house, and John Demeritt, with the other half snugly hidden under
      a load of straw, was on the road to Madbury driving along his oxen as
      unconcernedly as if nothing had happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day Governor Wentworth issued a proclamation, declaring all those
      who took part in the capture of Fort William and Mary guilty of high
      treason. Four months later the news from Lexington and Concord spread from
      the White Hills of New Hampshire to the pine forests of the Carolinas
      arousing the people to a renewed determination to defend with their
      lives—their rights and liberties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Major Sullivan, accompanied by his faithful little band, started at once
      for the scene of action. Indeed the New Hampshire troops were among the
      earliest at the front, for Bancroft tells us “the ferries on the Merrimack
      were crowded with the men of New Hampshire,” and that “they finally
      paraded on Cambridge Common having <i>run</i> rather than walked the
      entire distance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Captain John Demeritt, after
      reserving a portion of the powder for the use of his own company, brought
      out the remainder from his cellar and once more concealing it beneath a
      load of straw carted it with his ox team all the way to the headquarters
      of the American Army at Cambridge. He arrived in time to have it sent out
      to the troops at Bunker Hill, and a local historian tells us that it was
      stated on the best authority, that had not the powder arrived at so
      opportune a moment the fate of the day would have been far different. It
      was with this powder that the New Hampshire troops with two regiments from
      Connecticut guarded the flank at Bunker Hill, twice driving back the
      British. And it was with the same powder that they held the enemy at bay
      until Prescott’s little band had left the redoubt and then they retreated
      in good order through a galling fire.

        “Don’t fire till you see the whites of their eyes” were the orders of
        “Old Put” to the Yankee farmers who first taught the enemy that they
        could and would stand and fight British regulars.

      THE sound of drum and trumpet, the clatter of hoofs, the rattling of
      gun-carriages, and all the other military din and bustle in the streets of
      Boston, soon apprised the Americans on their rudely fortified height of an
      impending attack. They were ill-fitted to withstand it, being jaded by the
      night’s labor and want of sleep; hungry and thirsty, having brought but
      scanty supplies, and oppressed by the heat of the weather. Prescott sent
      repeated messages to General Ward, asking reinforcements and provisions.
      Putnam seconded the request in person, urging the exigencies of the case.
      Ward hesitated. He feared to weaken his main body at Cambridge, as his
      military stores were deposited there, and it might have to sustain the
      principal attack. At length, having taken advice of the council of safety,
      he issued orders for Colonels Stark and Read, then at Medford, to march to
      the relief of Prescott with their New Hampshire regiments. The<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_80"
        >[80]</span
      >
      orders reached Medford about eleven o’clock. Ammunition was distributed in
      all haste; two flints, a gill of powder, and fifteen balls to each man.
      The balls had to be suited to the different calibres of the guns; the
      powder to be carried in powder-horns, or loose in the pocket, for there
      were no cartridges prepared. It was the rude turn-out of yeoman soldiery
      destitute of regular accoutrements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meanwhile, the Americans on Breed’s Hill were sustaining the fire
      from the ships, and from the battery on Copp’s Hill, which opened upon
      them about ten o’clock. They returned an occasional shot from one corner
      of the redoubt, without much harm to the enemy, and continued
      strengthening their position until about eleven o’clock, when they ceased
      to work, piled their intrenching tools in the rear, and looked out
      anxiously and impatiently for the anticipated reinforcements and supplies.
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time General Putnam, who had been to headquarters, arrived at
      the redoubt on horseback. Some words passed between him and Prescott with
      regard to the intrenching tools, which have been variously reported. The
      most probable version is, that he urged to have them taken from their
      present place, where they might fall into the hands of the enemy, and
      carried to Bunker’s Hill, to be employed in throwing up a redoubt, which
      was part of the original plan, and which would be very important should
      the troops be obliged to retreat from Breed’s Hill. To this Prescott
      demurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> that those employed
      to convey them, and who were already jaded with toil, might not return to
      his redoubt. A large part of the tools were ultimately carried to Bunker’s
      Hill, and a breastwork commenced by order of General Putnam. The
      importance of such a work was afterward made apparent.
    </p>
    <p>
      About noon the Americans descried twenty-eight barges crossing from Boston
      in parallel lines. They contained a large detachment of grenadiers,
      rangers, and light infantry, admirably equipped, and commanded by
      Major-general Howe. They made a splendid and formidable appearance with
      their scarlet uniforms, and the sun flashing upon muskets and bayonets,
      and brass fieldpieces. A heavy fire from the ships and batteries covered
      their advance, but no attempt was made to oppose them, and they landed
      about one o’clock at Moulton’s Point, a little to the north of Breed’s
      Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here General Howe made a pause. On reconnoitering the works from this
      point, the Americans appeared to be much more strongly posted than he had
      imagined. He descried troops also hastening to their assistance. These
      were the New Hampshire troops, led on by Stark. Howe immediately sent over
      to General Gage for more forces, and a supply of cannon-balls; those
      brought by him being found, through some egregious oversight, too large
      for the ordnance. While awaiting their arrival, refreshments were served
      out to the troops, with “grog” by the bucketful; and tantalizing<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_82"
        >[82]</span
      >
      it was, to the hungry and thirsty provincials, to look down from their
      ramparts of earth, and see their invaders seated in groups upon the grass
      eating and drinking, and preparing themselves by a hearty meal for the
      coming encounter. Their only consolation was to take advantage of the
      delay, while the enemy were carousing, to strengthen their position. The
      breastwork on the left of the redoubt extended to what was called the
      Slough, but beyond this, the ridge of the hill, and the slope toward
      Mystic River, were undefended, leaving a pass by which the enemy might
      turn the left flank of the position and seize upon Bunker’s Hill. Putnam
      ordered his chosen officer, Captain Knowlton, to cover this pass with the
      Connecticut troops under his command. A novel kind of rampart, savoring of
      rural device, was suggested by the rustic general. About six hundred feet
      in the rear of the redoubt, and about one hundred feet to the left of the
      breastwork, was a post-and-rail fence, set in a low footwall of stone, and
      extending down to Mystic River. The posts and rails of another fence were
      hastily pulled up and set a few feet in behind this, and the intermediate
      space was filled up with new-mown hay from the adjacent meadows. This
      double fence, it will be found, proved an important protection to the
      redoubt, although there still remained an unprotected interval of about
      seven hundred feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Knowlton and his men were putting up this fence, Putnam proceeded
      with other of his troops to throw up the work on Bunker’s Hill,
      despatching his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span> son, Captain
      Putnam, on horseback, to hurry up the remainder of his men from Cambridge.
      By this time his compeer in French and Indian warfare, the veteran Stark,
      made his appearance with the New Hampshire troops, five hundred strong. He
      had grown cool and wary with age, and his march from Medford, a distance
      of five or six miles, had been in character. He led his men at a moderate
      pace, to bring them into action fresh and vigorous. In crossing the Neck,
      which was enfiladed by the enemy’s ships and batteries, Captain Dearborn,
      who was by his side, suggested a quick step. The veteran shook his head:
      “One fresh man in action is worth ten tired ones,” replied he, and marched
      steadily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putnam detained some of Stark’s men to aid in throwing up the work on
      Bunker’s Hill, and directed him to reinforce Knowlton with the rest. Stark
      made a short speech to his men, now that they were likely to have warm
      work. He then pushed on, and did good service that day at the rustic
      bulwark.
    </p>
    <p>
      About two o’clock Warren arrived on the heights, ready to engage in their
      perilous defence, although he had opposed the scheme of their occupation.
      He had recently been elected a major-general, but had not received his
      commission; like Pomeroy, he came to serve in the ranks with a musket on
      his shoulder. Putnam offered him the command at the fence; he declined it,
      and merely asked where he could be of most service as a volunteer. Putnam
      pointed to the redoubt, observing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84"
        >[84]</span
      >
      that there he would be under cover. “Don’t think I seek a place of
      safety,” replied Warren quickly; “where will the attack be the hottest?”
      Putnam still pointed to the redoubt. “That is the enemy’s object; if that
      can be maintained, the day is ours.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Warren was cheered by the troops as he entered the redoubt. Colonel
      Prescott tendered him the command. He again declined. “I have come to
      serve only as a volunteer, and shall be happy to learn from a soldier of
      your experience.” Such were the noble spirits assembled on these perilous
      heights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The British now prepared for a general assault. An easy victory was
      anticipated; the main thought was, how to make it most effectual. The left
      wing, commanded by General Pigot, was to mount the hill and force the
      redoubt; while General Howe, with the right wing, was to push on between
      the fort and Mystic River, turn the left flank of the Americans, and cut
      off their retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Pigot, accordingly, advanced up the hill under cover of a fire
      from fieldpieces and howitzers planted on a small height near the
      landing-place on Moulton’s Point. His troops commenced a discharge of
      musketry while yet at a long distance from the redoubts. The Americans
      within the works, obedient to strict command, retained their fire until
      the enemy were within thirty or forty paces, when they opened upon them
      with a tremendous volley. Being all marksmen, accustomed to take
      deliberate aim, the slaughter was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85"
        >[85]</span
      >
      immense, and especially fatal to officers. The assailants fell back in
      some confusion; but rallied on by their officers, advanced within pistol
      shot. Another volley, more effective than the first, made them again
      recoil. To add to their confusion, they were galled by a flanking fire
      from the handful of provincials posted in Charlestown. Shocked at the
      carnage, and seeing the confusion of his troops, General Pigot was urged
      to give the word for a retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime, General Howe, with the right wing, advanced along Mystic
      River toward the fence where Stark, Read, and Knowlton were stationed,
      thinking to carry this slight breastwork with ease, and so get in the rear
      of the fortress. His artillery proved of little avail, being stopped by a
      swampy piece of ground, while his columns suffered from two or three
      fieldpieces with which Putnam had fortified the fence. Howe’s men kept up
      a fire of musketry as they advanced; but, not taking aim, their shots
      passed over the heads of the Americans. The latter had received the same
      orders with those in the redoubt, not to fire until the enemy should be
      within thirty paces. Some few transgressed the command. Putnam rode up and
      swore he would cut down the next man that fired contrary to orders. When
      the British arrived within the stated distance a sheeted fire opened upon
      them from rifles, muskets, and fowling-pieces, all leveled with deadly
      aim. The carnage, as in the other instance, was horrible. The British were
      thrown into confusion and fell back; some even retreated to the boats.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>There was a general pause on
      the part of the British. The American officers availed themselves of it to
      prepare for another attack, which must soon be made. Prescott mingled
      among his men in the redoubt, who were all in high spirits at the severe
      check they had given “the regulars.” He praised them for their
      steadfastness in maintaining their post, and their good conduct in
      reserving their fire until the word of command, and exhorted them to do
      the same in the next attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Putnam rode about Bunker’s Hill and its skirts, to rally and bring on
      reinforcements which had been checked or scattered in crossing Charlestown
      Neck by the raking fire from the ships and batteries. Before many could be
      brought to the scene of action the British had commenced their second
      attack. They again ascended the hill to storm the redoubt; their advance
      was covered as before by discharges of artillery. Charlestown, which had
      annoyed them on their first attack by a flanking fire, was in flames, by
      shells thrown from Copp’s Hill, and by marines from the ships. Being built
      of wood, the place was soon wrapped in a general conflagration. The
      thunder of artillery from batteries and ships; the bursting of
      bomb-shells; the sharp discharges of musketry; the shouts and yells of the
      combatants; the crash of burning buildings, and the dense volumes of
      smoke, which obscured the summer sun, all formed a tremendous spectacle.
      “Sure I am,” said Burgoyne in one of his letters—“Sure I am nothing ever
      has or ever can be more dreadfully<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87"
        >[87]</span
      >
      terrible than what was to be seen or heard at this time. The most
      incessant discharge of guns that ever was heard by mortal ears.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The American troops, although unused to war, stood undismayed amidst a
      scene where it was bursting upon them with all its horrors. Reserving
      their fire, as before, until the enemy was close at hand, they again
      poured forth repeated volleys with the fatal aim of sharpshooters. The
      British stood the first shock, and continued to advance; but the incessant
      stream of fire staggered them. Their officers remonstrated, threatened,
      and even attempted to goad them on with their swords, but the havoc was
      too deadly; whole ranks were mowed down; many of the officers were either
      slain or wounded, and among them several of the staff of General Howe. The
      troops again gave way and retreated down the hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this passed under the eye of thousands of spectators of both sexes and
      all ages, watching from afar every turn of a battle in which the lives of
      those most dear to them were at hazard. The British soldiery in Boston
      gazed with astonishment and almost incredulity at the resolute and
      protracted stand of raw militia whom they had been taught to despise, and
      at the havoc made among their own veteran troops. Every convoy of wounded
      brought over to the town increased their consternation; and General
      Clinton, who had watched the action from Copp’s Hill, embarking in a boat,
      hurried over as a volunteer, taking with him reinforcements.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>A third attack was now
      determined on, though some of Howe’s officers remonstrated, declaring it
      would be downright butchery. A different plan was adopted. Instead of
      advancing in front of the redoubt, it was to be taken in flank on the
      left, where the open space between the breastwork and the fortified fence
      presented a weak point. It having been accidentally discovered that the
      ammunition of the Americans was nearly expended, preparations were made to
      carry the works at the point of the bayonet; and the soldiery threw off
      their knapsacks, and some even their coats, to be more light for action.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Howe, with the main body, now made a feint of attacking the
      fortified fence; but, while a part of his force was thus engaged, the rest
      brought some of the fieldpieces to enfilade the breastwork on the left of
      the redoubt. A raking fire soon drove the Americans out of this exposed
      place into the enclosure. Much damage, too, was done in the latter by
      balls which entered the sally-port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The troops were now led on to assail the works; those who flinched were,
      as before, goaded on by the swords of the officers. The Americans again
      reserved their fire until their assailants were close at hand, and then
      made a murderous volley, by which several officers were laid low, and
      General Howe himself was wounded in the foot. The British soldiery this
      time likewise reserved their fire and rushed on with fixed bayonet.
      Clinton and Pigot had reached the southern and eastern<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_89"
        >[89]</span
      >
      sides of the redoubt, and it was now assailed on three sides at once.
      Prescott ordered those who had no bayonets to retire to the back part of
      the redoubt and fire on the enemy as they showed themselves above the
      parapet. The first who mounted exclaimed in triumph, “The day is ours!” He
      was instantly shot down, and so were several others who mounted at the
      same time. The Americans, however, had fired their last round, their
      ammunition was exhausted; and now succeeded a desperate and deadly
      struggle, hand to hand, with bayonets, stones, and the stocks of their
      muskets. At length, as the British continued to pour in, Prescott gave the
      order to retreat. His men had to cut their way through two divisions of
      the enemy who were getting in rear of the redoubt, and they received a
      destructive volley from those who had formed on the captured works. By
      that volley fell the patriot Warren, who had distinguished himself
      throughout the action. He was among the last to leave the redoubt, and had
      scarce done so when he was shot through the head with a musket-ball, and
      fell dead on the spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the Americans were thus slowly dislodged from the redoubt, Stark,
      Read, and Knowlton maintained their ground at the fortified fence; which,
      indeed, had been nobly defended throughout the action. Pomeroy
      distinguished himself here by his sharp-shooting until his musket was
      shattered by a ball. The resistance at this hastily constructed work was
      kept up after the troops in the redoubt had given way,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_90"
        >[90]</span
      >
      and until Colonel Prescott had left the hill; thus defeating General
      Howe’s design of cutting off the retreat of the main body, which would
      have produced a scene of direful confusion and slaughter. Having effected
      their purpose, the brave associates at the fence abandoned their weak
      outpost, retiring slowly, and disputing the ground inch by inch, with a
      regularity remarkable in troops many of whom had never before been in
      action.
    </p>
    <p>
      The main retreat was across Bunker’s Hill, where Putnam had endeavored to
      throw up a breastwork. The veteran, sword in hand, rode to the rear of the
      retreating troops, regardless of the balls whistling about him. His only
      thought was to rally them at the unfinished works. “Halt! make a stand
      here!” cried he, “we can check them yet. In God’s name form and give them
      one shot more.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pomeroy, wielding his shattered musket as a truncheon, seconded him in his
      efforts to stay the torrent. It was impossible, however, to bring the
      troops to a stand. They continued on down the hill to the Neck, and across
      it to Cambridge, exposed to a raking fire from the ships and batteries,
      and only protected by a single piece of ordnance. The British were too
      exhausted to pursue them; they contented themselves with taking possession
      of Bunker’s Hill, were reinforced from Boston, and threw up additional
      works during the night.

        How a certain little girl prepared for General Washington the “best
        breakfast he had had in a month.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap2">
      LONG, long ago, when my mother was a little girl, there lived in her
      neighborhood an old lady whom all the children called “Aunt Prissy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      She was a quaint, funny little old lady, with her bobbing white curls, and
      always wore a small black lace cap, a black silk gown, a soft white
      kerchief, and fringed silk apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The children loved to pay a visit to Aunt Prissy. After they were all
      carefully seated, each child with a small seed-cake, the eager little
      faces would turn toward her, and one of the children would say, “Now, Aunt
      Prissy, we won’t drop crumbs on the floor, and we are sitting up straight,
      and we haven’t got our knees crossed, so won’t you please tell us about
      the time you saw General Washington with your own eyes?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Prissy would count the stitches in her knitting, look up over her
      “specs,” and begin, “Well, well, children, it does seem to me you ought to
      know <i>that</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span> story by
      heart. But never mind; I s’pose you know which you like best.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now let me see. It must have been in ’81, and I was nine years old, that
      our folks went to Salisbury to see General Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I had been in disgrace for a whole day, and for punishment it was decided
      that I must stay at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My poor little heart almost broke, and I cried and made myself altogether
      disagreeable while the great lunch-baskets were being strapped behind the
      carriage, the huge bunches of roses to hurl at the general wrapped in wet
      cotton, and the family bundled into the carriages.
    </p>
    <p>
      “After they had gone I wandered disconsolately about house and garden. As
      I was swinging on the gate and wondering what I would do next, I heard a
      great clatter of horses’ feet up the road, and in a few minutes a party of
      men in uniform came in sight. I had seen enough soldiers to know that
      these were Continental officers, so I was not frightened, but waited until
      they came up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A tall man on a white horse, with a cocked hat and plain uniform, rode
      forward, and with the kindest smile in the world, asked, ‘My little girl,
      can you give us a cup of coffee?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now I was very proud of being able to make coffee and batter-cakes, so I
      said I would try. The gentlemen rode into the yard, their servants came
      forward to take the horses, and I showed the party into the house.<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_93"
        >[93]</span
      >
      Mammy Dilsie had gone to the quarters on an errand, so I had things my own
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A fire was blazing in the huge kitchen fireplace. We didn’t have
      cooking-stoves in those days, but did our baking in great round iron
      ovens, with lids to heap coals on, and our boiling in pots swung over the
      coals on cranes. I raked out a nice bed of coals, filled the big
      coffee-pot, and soon had it simmering, then put the pan for the
      batter-cakes on to heat, made them up, had them nicely browned in a trice,
      set out a cold ham, and then invited the gentlemen in to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      “They came, laughing and talking, said the coffee was the best they had
      ever tasted, the cakes delicious. I poured the coffee, and the gentlemen
      laughed and joked me, and one of them asked how I happened to be at home
      all alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My eyes filled with tears and I could hardly speak, but managed to tell
      him that everybody had gone to Salisbury to see General Washington; and
      that I wanted to see him worst of all because in the picture of him in my
      red book one of his eyes was blue and the other brown, and I wanted to see
      if it was really true. The officers all laughed at this, but the leader
      raised his hand, and they did not say anything.
    </p>
    <p>“‘But why did you not go, little maid?’ he asked.</p>
    <p>
      “Then I hung my head, but at last blurted out, ‘Because I tried to bury
      John’s ten little biddies in the sand.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “The men roared again at this; but the tall one said,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_94"
        >[94]</span
      >
      ‘Did you not know that it was very wrong to hurt the little chicks?’
    </p>
    <p>
      “I began to cry then, but the kind officer took me on his knee and kissed
      me.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘And now, my little maid,’ he said, ‘you may tell your mother that you
      did see General Washington and gave him the best breakfast he has had in a
      month. And you see, his eyes are neither brown nor blue, but gray.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I looked into his kind face and saw that the red book was not even
      half right. Then Mammy Dilsie came in and courtesied to the floor when I
      told her who it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The gentlemen patted me on the head, General Washington kissed me again,
      and they rode away.”

      <h2 class="nobreak">FAMOUS WORDS AT GREAT MOMENTS</h2>
    </div>
    <h3>PATRICK HENRY</h3>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      TEN years and more before the Declaration of Independence there was great
      excitement in the Colonies over the new Stamp Act. Patrick Henry, a young
      member of the General Assembly of Virginia, had the temerity to offer a
      resolution which declared that in the General Assembly lay the sole right
      and power to lay taxes upon the Colony. An excited debate followed this
      resolution, in the course of which Patrick Henry arose and addressed the
      assembly. His speech closed with the words which have made him famous:
      <i
        >Cæsar had his Brutus, Charles the First his Cromwell, and George the
        Third</i
      >—The hall rang with cries of <i>Treason! Treason!</i> The patriot orator
      paused for an impressive moment, and then continued calmly;—<i
        >may profit by their example. If this be treason make the most of it!</i
      >
    </p>
    <p>(His resolution was carried.)</p>
    <p>
      A decade passed before the actual outbreak of the War in New England
      inspired Patrick Henry to the oration which concluded thus:
      <i
        >It is in vain, Sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry peace,
        peace—but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> there is no
        peace. The war has actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the
        North will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms. Our brethren
        are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that
        gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so
        sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains or slavery? Forbid it,
        Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but as for me,
        give me liberty, or give me death!</i
      >
    </p>
    <h3>BATTLE OF LEXINGTON</h3>
    <p>
      Very early on the morning of April 19, 1775, Paul Revere, by his famous
      ride, had warned the men of Lexington of the coming of the redcoats. About
      half-past four the patriots’ drum beat to arms and the minute-men came
      hurrying from all directions, to receive the instructions of their
      stalwart Captain, John Parker. His orders were:
      <i
        >Stand your ground, don’t fire unless fired upon, but if they mean to
        have a war, let it begin here.</i
      >
      Then came Major Pitcairn’s insolent order,
      <i>Disperse, ye rebels, disperse!</i> Actually, the first trigger was
      pulled by a hot-headed young American. His gun, however, failed to go off.
      A British soldier then discharged his piece—and the War began.
    </p>
    <h3>BUNKER HILL</h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Joseph Warren, who was slain at Bunker Hill, when urged by Elbridge
      Gerry not to go into the fight, replied quietly, and we know sincerely:
      <i
        >Dulce et decorum<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span> est pro
        patria mori</i
      >
      (To die for one’s country is both agreeable and fitting). He had that very
      day been appointed a Major-General by Congress, but had not yet received
      his Commission. When he presented himself before Colonel Prescott, the
      latter naturally tendered him the command. But Warren replied with the
      modesty which so often characterizes the bravest of men,
      <i>I come as a volunteer with my musket to serve under you</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the British General Gage heard of Warren’s death he is said to have
      remarked,
      <i>It is well; that one man was equal to five hundred ordinary soldiers</i
      >. It was probably General Israel Putnam—“Old Put”—commanding at the rail
      fence at Bunker Hill, who gave the famous order,
      <i>Don’t fire until you can see the whites of their eyes</i>. This was
      because the patriots’ powder was so pitifully short. Colonel Prescott’s
      injunction was, <i>Don’t waste a grain; make every shot tell</i>.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      Washington was journeying to New England to take command of the army when
      the Battle of Bunker Hill was fought. On hearing of it he inquired
      anxiously, <i>Did they stand the fire of the regulars?</i>
      <i>That they did</i>, was the response, and
      <i>held their own fire in reserve until the enemy was within eight rods</i
      >. <i>Then</i>, said Washington,
      <i>the liberties of the country are safe</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bunker Hill Monument, it will be remembered, inspired one of Daniel
      Webster’s greatest orations. This is its peroration:
      <i
        >When honored and decrepit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
        age shall lean against the base of this monument, and troops of vigorous
        youths shall be gathered around it, and when the one shall speak to the
        other of its objects, the purposes of its construction, and the great
        and glorious events with which it was connected—then shall come from
        every youthful breast the ejaculation—Thank God!—I also—am an
        American!</i
      >
    </p>
    <h3>NATHAN HALE</h3>
    <p>
      After Washington’s retreat, following the battle of Long Island, he was
      most anxious to discover the intentions of the British in New York. Nathan
      Hale, a young Captain from Connecticut—he had formerly been a
      schoolmaster—volunteered to try and secure this information. He was
      detected, arrested, and summarily condemned by the British, however, and
      as he stood under the fatal noose awaiting the ignominious death of a spy,
      the brutal British officer, Cunningham, who was in charge of the execution
      shouted at him, <i>Give us your dying speech, you young rebel.</i> And
      Hale replied in a calm, clear voice,
      <i>I only regret that I have but one life to lose for my country</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>WILLIAM PITT</h3>
    <p>
      Young people sometimes forget that the patriots’ cause had many friends
      among the wiser statesmen of England. William Pitt was brave enough to
      say:
      <i
        >We are told that the Americans are obstinate, that they are in almost
        open rebellion against us. I rejoice that America<span
          class="pagenum"
          id="Page_99"
          >[99]</span
        >
        has resisted. I rejoice that they are not so dead to all feelings of
        liberty as to be willing to submit like slaves!</i
      >
    </p>
    <h3>GEORGE WASHINGTON</h3>
    <p>
      The winter at Valley Forge was a time of bitter discouragement for
      Washington and his cause. Tradition has preserved a touching picture of
      the great man in his lonely hour of trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Quaker farmer, Isaac Potts, one day returned home joyful and confident
      in the ultimate success of the Americans:
      <i>George Washington will succeed! George Washington will succeed!</i> he
      told his wife. <i>What makes thee think so, Isaac?</i> was her reply.
      <i
        >I have heard him pray, Hannah, alone out in the woods to-day. The
        Generals horse was tied to a sapling in a thicket. He himself was on his
        knees, praying most fervently. The Lord will surely hear his prayer. He
        will, Hannah; thee may rest assured, he will.</i
      >
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      Washington’s soldiers were often exasperated by the pettiness and tedious
      delays of Congress. On one occasion a group of them proposed to improve
      matters by making their leader King. His downright reply to the man who
      finally summoned sufficient courage to broach the matter to him is too
      little known:
      <i
        >I am at a loss to conceive what part of my conduct could have given
        encouragement to an address which seems to me big with the greatest
        mischief that can befall any country.... Let me conjure you, if you have
        any regard for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span> your
        country, concern for yourself or posterity, or respect for me, to banish
        these thoughts from your mind, and never communicate, as from yourself
        or any one else, a sentiment of the like nature!</i
      >
    </p>
    <h3>ETHAN ALLEN</h3>
    <p>
      When Ethan Allen, the Green Mountain Boy, broke into Fort Ticonderoga at
      the head of a handful of followers and demanded its surrender, its
      bewildered and still sleepy Commandant began to stutter out a very natural
      inquiry as to the authority in whose name Allen acted. History has
      recorded Allen’s grandiloquent reply:
      <i>In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!</i> (But
      certain old Vermonters will have it that his actual words were,
      <i
        >Here, come out of that, you old rascal and give us the fort, quick, or
        we’ll smoke you out like rats!</i
      >)
    </p>
    <h3>ANTHONY WAYNE</h3>
    <p>
      Mad Anthony Wayne was wounded in the head by a musket-ball during his
      famous assault on Stony Point. He fell to the ground with blood streaming
      over his face, and for a moment supposed himself to be mortally wounded.
      His order to his aids was eminently characteristic,
      <i>Carry me into the fort and let me die at the head of the column</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>JOHN STARK</h3>
    <p>
      It was before the Battle of Bennington, fought and won in defiance of the
      orders of the too cautious Congress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101"
        >[101]</span
      >
      that bold John Stark uttered his famous invocation to his men:
      <i>There they are, boys</i>, he shouted, waving his sword toward the
      enemy; <i>we’ll get ’em, or to-night Molly Stark’ll be a widow</i>.
    </p>
    <h3>BENEDICT ARNOLD</h3>
    <p>
      A pitiful story is told of the death in London, twenty years after the
      War, of Benedict Arnold, the traitor. His last request was for the old
      epaulettes and sword-knot given him by Washington. <i>Let me die</i>, said
      he,
      <i
        >in the old American uniform, in which I fought my battles. God forgive
        me for ever having put on any other!</i
      >
    </p>
    <h3>GEORGE THE THIRD</h3>
    <p>
      It is well to remember, in these days, that George Washington was in
      reality an Englishman who fought a German king whom chance had seated on
      the throne of England. And it is well to recall also that George the
      Third, though obstinate and wrong-headed enough, gave in at last with a
      better grace than might have been expected. To John Adams, our first
      minister to England, he said:
      <i
        >Sir, I will be very free with you. I was the last to consent to the
        separation, but the separation having been made ... I have always said
        and I say now, that I would be the first to meet the friendship of the
        United States as an independent power.</i

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        John Holden was lost. His mother’s faith that God would take care of her
        boy was rewarded, however, when it was discovered that John with his
        little fife was helping to drill the soldiers in Washington’s army.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      MORE than a hundred years ago there lived, in the town of Shirley, Mass.,
      a bright, well-grown lad named John Holden. His father was a farmer, and
      the little fellow trudged about the farm, clad in home-spun and home-made
      clothing, feeding calves, driving cows, and doing whatever his hands found
      to do “with all his might.”
    </p>
    <p>
      One Saturday night John was early at the gate waiting for his father’s
      homecoming; for Saturday was the day when John Holden went to the village,
      and returned laden with packages and news from Boston—which to them was
      the centre of the world. A present was an unheard-of thing in little
      John’s life. What was his surprise, then, as his father rode up to the
      gate, to see him hand out a long black case, saying:
    </p>
    <p>“Here, my boy, see what I’ve brought you for a birthday present.”</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>And imagine his greater
      astonishment, on opening the case, to see a beautiful fife of dark wood
      with silver trimmings!
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy could hardly believe his own eyes; and as he was passionately fond
      of music he lost no time in beginning to learn the use of his newly
      acquired instrument. He carried the fife with him everywhere and practised
      on it in every spare moment, and before many months he was able to greatly
      astonish the villagers and won many a compliment by his skillful playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just before the Revolutionary War the whole country, as every boy and girl
      ought to know, was in a state of ferment and dread. War seemed inevitable,
      and the oppressive rule of the English was the theme of conversation
      everywhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little John heard much of it, and longed to be a man that he might join
      the “rebellious colonists.” And one day he received a compliment which set
      him thinking of matters in a way the older members of his family never
      mistrusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      A visitor from Boston was at the farmhouse, and the talk, as usual, ran on
      the prospect of war in the colonies. During a pause in the conversation,
      Mr. Holden asked John to play something on the fife. When he had played a
      stirring march or two, the stranger exclaimed, “Upon my word! But the boy
      has the soul of music in him! He will be ready for the British bulls and
      lions when it is necessary.”
    </p>
    <p>
      John sat quite still for some time. But before he<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_104"
        >[104]</span
      >
      went to bed he went to his father and said, “Father, if the British do
      come, shall I go to war with my fife?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “To be sure,” answered his father laughingly. “They could not get along
      without you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Long after his father had forgotten this incident, John Holden took his
      dog Zip, and his darling fife, and went to a favorite hill on the place to
      practise. At night the dog came back alone and going straight up to the
      boy’s chamber began to moan and cry, and would not leave John’s bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were greatly alarmed, and instantly divined that something had
      happened to John.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon the whole town was in commotion; for the news that John Holden was
      lost flew like wildfire. Bands of men were organized and went searching
      the woods in every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indians had been traveling through the town recently. Had they carried off
      the boy or had they stolen the valuable fife and thrown the boy into the
      river? The woods were hunted through and through; the river was dragged;
      notices of the lost boy were sent in every direction; but weeks lengthened
      into months and no clew was obtained that threw the faintest glimmer of
      light on the strange disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody believed him to be dead, or with the cruel Indians. Everybody
      but one. The boy’s mother never lost faith in his being safe somewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My boy is in God’s hands,” she would say. “In his good time John will
      come home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>And nothing could move her
      from this belief while two anxious years slipped by.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime war had broken out, and Shirley had sent her full quota of
      men to fight for the country’s independence. It was through one of these
      that a rumor reached Mr. Holden that a boy of twelve was in General
      Washington’s army as fifer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jonas Holden was impressed with the certainty that the boy in Washington’s
      army and his lost son were the same. He went home and told his wife the
      story, and she was certain of it. Accordingly Mr. Holden started for New
      York, where General Washington and his army were then stationed. There
      were no railroads or telegraphs then, remember; nothing but horses and
      stagecoaches. Mr. Holden chose the former, and the best he could do, by
      traveling on horseback, was to reach General Washington’s headquarters in
      seven days.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he finally drew rein at the outposts of the Continental Army, he made
      known his desire to see General Knox, who was with Washington at that
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Knox received the Massachusetts farmer with a cordiality that put
      him at his ease in a moment; and Mr. Holden found no difficulty in stating
      his errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There is your boy, sir!” exclaimed the interested General, pointing to a
      young fellow in a soldier’s suit, gay with brass buttons, who was playing
      on a fife. “He is drilling some raw recruits. That boy is Captain-general
      of us all, sir. I have never known him to<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_106"
        >[106]</span
      >
      whimper or say ‘I can’t,’ although he is the youngest of us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The fifer was sent for in the Colonel’s name. As he drew near, and lifting
      his cap, asked, “Did you send for me, sir?” his eye fell on his father
      sitting in a corner of the tent.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the boy was in his father’s arms and sobbing like a baby. The
      father’s tears were mingled with the long-lost son’s and the redoubtable
      General was obliged to resort to his handkerchief as he withdrew, leaving
      father and son alone, with the remark:
    </p>
    <p>“I will see our Commander-in-chief.”</p>
    <p>
      “When did you come?” said John, when he could speak. “And how did you find
      me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Old Captain brought me,” was the reply, “and he can take us both home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And how is mother?” pursued the boy. “Oh! I have been so sorry for dear
      mother. I tell you, father, not a night have I camped down to sleep but I
      have thought of mother; and every time I thought of her the tears came. I
      thought perhaps she might die and I should never see her again.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your mother is well,” was the father’s answer. “And she has never for one
      moment lost faith in your being well and happy, and finally restored to
      us.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, I shall return, father,” said John. “But I want this war ended
      first.”
    </p>
    <p>After the boy had inquired for all the family, he said:</p>
    <p>“But why didn’t you bring Zip along, too?”</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>“Poor Zip!” was the reply.
      “He mourned himself to death before you had been gone a week. He never
      touched another mouthful of food, and would only lie on your bed and
      moan.”
    </p>
    <p>
      General Knox soon returned with orders from the Commander-in-chief to
      conduct Mr. Holden and John to his headquarters—a summons that must be
      obeyed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Washington received Mr. Holden very kindly and said smilingly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I hear a story that sounds like a romance in the midst of war. Tell me,
      my little fifer, how you came to leave your parents without their
      knowledge, and to join my army at such a tender age?”
    </p>
    <p>
      John was somewhat abashed by this direct question from so dignified and
      august a personage; but the General added kindly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have the name of being one of my bravest boys. Tell me how it
      happened. You never ran away, did you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, sir, never,” answered John with spirit. “I was playing with my dog
      Zip, on Sorrel Hill, when a big wagon, full of men, came along. They
      stopped when they saw me, and one of them called out, ‘Halloo, my little
      fifer! We are looking for you. Jump in.’ I asked them if the British bulls
      and lions were here, and they said ‘Yes, hurry up!’ I jumped in, sir, and
      that was the way it happened.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden then remembered, for the first time, what he had said long ago,
      when John asked him if he would be needed when the British bulls and lions
      appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>John’s story was met by a
      burst of laughter quite unusual with Washington. Then patting the boy’s
      rosy cheeks, the General said, “After this you must give us some music, my
      lad.”
    </p>
    <p>And John, quite elated, rendered a stirring march.</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t see how we can part with this brave boy of yours,” said General
      Washington to Mr. Holden when the boy had finished playing; “but parents
      have the first claim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      John was just then ordered to go and dismiss the men he had been drilling,
      and he departed with a martial salute to his superiors, and “I will be
      back in five minutes,” to his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Holden, left alone, told the story of the mother’s deep faith, and
      added, “John seems to be in his element here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then General Washington told the gratified parent an incident, showing the
      spirit of the lad.
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I, with a number of my suite, approached the vicinity of Monmouth
      Court House,” said he, “I was met by a little musician, who archly cried
      out, ‘They are all coming this way, your Honor!’”
    </p>
    <p>“‘Who are coming this way?’” said I.</p>
    <p>
      “‘Why, our boys, your Honor! Our boys! and the British are right after
      them!’”
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘Impossible!’ I cried; but spurring my horse, I found the boy’s words
      only too true.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He is a good boy,” added General Knox, “and invaluable in training raw
      recruits. If they are homesick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109"
        >[109]</span
      >
      he talks kindly with them and cheers them wonderfully with his ardent
      patriotism.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy just then returned and General Knox added, “Well, what did your
      men say when you told them you were going home?”
    </p>
    <p>
      John blushed and answered, “I could not tell them that, your Honor.
      Father, let me stay another year. Then I shall be thirteen and able to
      help you more on the farm. You know mother is well, and the war will soon
      be over.”
    </p>
    <p>What father in Revolutionary times could resist such an appeal?</p>
    <p>
      Washington smiled, and Mr. Holden consented. And after a kind farewell
      from the Father of his Country, and a loving one from the young fifer,
      Jonas Holden rode away, saying to himself:
    </p>
    <p>
      “My boy could not hold a more honored position. I leave him safe in the
      hands of General Washington—and of God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When, after seven more days of horseback riding, Jonas Golden arrived at
      his own door in Shirley, he was met by his maiden sister with the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Disappointed again! So it wasn’t our John at all? I tell you, you’ll
      never see that boy again.”
    </p>
    <p>But Mr. Holden held out his hand to the boy’s mother.</p>
    <p>
      “My dear,” he said, “John is the happiest boy in the Continental Army.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It took a long time to tell the story of the journey;<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_110"
        >[110]</span
      >
      of his reception at Washington’s headquarters; of his finding the boy; of
      his growth, improvement, and popularity; of his close adherence to the
      principles of right and truth which they had taught him; and of the great
      Commander’s praise of their son. But at last the father said:
    </p>
    <p>“Have I done right in leaving him there?”</p>
    <p>“Just right,” said the mother.</p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      John Holden returned to his parents when the war was over and lived to a
      good old age. And his name may be seen, for the searching, even now, on
      the books at Washington, as a pensioner of 1776.

      <p>
        The story of the capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Robin Hood of the
        New Hampshire Grants.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap2">
      AS affairs were now drawing to a crisis, and war was considered
      inevitable, some bold spirits in Connecticut conceived a project for the
      outset. This was the surprisal of the old forts of Ticonderoga and Crown
      Point, already famous in the French war. Their situation on Lake Champlain
      gave them the command of the main route to Canada; so that the possession
      of them would be all-important in case of hostilities. They were feebly
      garrisoned and negligently guarded, and abundantly furnished with,
      artillery and military stores so much needed by the patriot army.
    </p>
    <p>
      This scheme was set on foot in the purlieus, as it were, of the provincial
      Legislature of Connecticut, then in session. It was not openly sanctioned
      by that body, but secretly favored, and money lent from the treasury to
      those engaged in it. A committee was appointed, also, to accompany them to
      the frontier, aid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> them in
      raising troops, and exercise over them a degree of superintendence and
      control.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sixteen men were thus enlisted in Connecticut, a greater number in
      Massachusetts, but the greatest accession of force was from what was
      called the “New Hampshire Grants.” This was a region having the
      Connecticut River on one side and Lake Champlain and the Hudson River on
      the other—being, in fact, the country forming the present State of
      Vermont. It had long been a disputed territory claimed by New York and New
      Hampshire. George II had decided in favor of New York; but the Governor of
      New Hampshire had made grants of between one and two hundred townships in
      it, whence it had acquired the name of the New Hampshire Grants. The
      settlers on those grants resisted the attempts of New York to eject them,
      and formed themselves into an association called “The Green Mountain
      Boys.” Resolute, strong-handed fellows they were, with Ethan Allen at
      their head, a native of Connecticut, but brought up among the Green
      Mountains. He and his lieutenants, Seth Warner and Remember Baker, were
      outlawed by the Legislature of New York, and rewards offered for their
      apprehension. They and their associates armed themselves, set New York at
      defiance, and swore they would be the death of any one who should attempt
      their arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus Ethan Allen was becoming a kind of Robin Hood among the mountains,
      when the present crisis changed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113"
        >[113]</span
      >
      the relative position of things as if by magic. Boundary feuds were
      forgotten amid the great questions of colonial rights. Ethan Allen at once
      stepped forward, a patriot, and volunteered with his Green Mountain Boys
      to serve in the popular cause. He was well fitted for the enterprise in
      question, by his experience as a frontier champion, his robustness of mind
      and body, and his fearless spirit. He had a kind of rough eloquence, also,
      that was very effective with his followers. “His style,” says one, who
      knew him personally, “was a singular compound of local barbarisms,
      Scriptural phrases, and oriental wildness; and though unclassic, and
      sometimes ungrammatical, was highly animated and forcible.” Washington, in
      one of his letters, says there was “an original something in him which
      commanded admiration.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus reinforced, the party, now two hundred and seventy strong, pushed
      forward to Castleton, a place within a few miles of the head of Lake
      Champlain. Here a council of war was held on the 2d of May. Ethan Allen
      was placed at the head of the expedition, with James Easton and Seth
      Warner as second and third in command. Detachments were sent off to
      Skenesborough (now Whitehall), and another place on the lake, with orders
      to seize all the boats they could find and bring them to Shoreham,
      opposite Ticonderoga, whither Allen prepared to proceed with the main
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture another adventurous spirit arrived at Castleton. This was
      Benedict Arnold, since so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
      sadly renowned. He, too, had conceived the project of surprising
      Ticonderoga and Crown Point; or, perhaps, had caught the idea from its
      first agitators in Connecticut—in the militia of which province he held a
      captain’s commission. He had proposed the scheme to the Massachusetts
      committee of safety. It had met their approbation. They had given him a
      colonel’s commission, authorized him to raise a force in western
      Massachusetts not exceeding four hundred men, and furnished him with money
      and means. Arnold had enlisted but a few officers and men when he heard of
      the expedition from Connecticut being on the march. He instantly hurried
      on with one attendant to overtake it, leaving his few recruits to follow
      as best they could; in this way he reached Castleton just after the
      council of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Producing the colonel’s commission received from the Massachusetts
      committee of safety, he now aspired to the supreme command. His claims
      were disregarded by the Green Mountain Boys; they would follow no leader
      but Ethan Allen. As they formed the majority of the party, Arnold was fain
      to acquiesce, and serve as a volunteer, with the rank, but not the
      command, of colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party arrived at Shoreham, opposite Ticonderoga, on the night of the
      9th of May. The detachment sent in quest of boats had failed to arrive.
      There were a few boats at hand, with which the transportation was
      commenced. It was slow work; the night wore<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_115"
        >[115]</span
      >
      away; day was about to break, and but eighty-three men, with Allen and
      Arnold, had crossed. Should they wait for the residue, day would dawn, the
      garrison wake, and their enterprise might fail. Allen drew up his men,
      addressed them in his own emphatic style, and announced his intention to
      make a dash at the fort without waiting for more force. “It is a desperate
      attempt,” said he, “and I ask no man to go against his will. I will take
      the lead, and be the first to advance. You that are willing to follow,
      poise your firelocks.” Not a firelock but was poised.
    </p>
    <p>
      They mounted the hill briskly but in silence, guided by a boy from the
      neighborhood. The day dawned as Allen arrived at a sally-port. A sentry
      pulled trigger on him, but his piece missed fire. He retreated through a
      covered way. Allen and his men followed. Another sentry thrust at Easton
      with his bayonet, but was struck down by Allen and begged for quarter. It
      was granted on condition of his leading the way instantly to the quarters
      of the commandant, Captain Delaplace, who was yet in bed. Being arrived
      there, Allen thundered at the door, and demanded a surrender of the fort.
      By this time his followers had formed into two lines on the parade-ground,
      and given three hearty cheers. The commandant appeared at his door half
      dressed, “the frightened face of his pretty wife peering over his
      shoulder.” He gazed at Allen in bewildered astonishment. “By whose
      authority do you act?” exclaimed he. “In the name of the great Jehovah and
      the Continental<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> Congress,”
      replied Allen, with a flourish of his sword, and an oath which we do not
      care to subjoin.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no disputing the point. The garrison, like the commander, had
      been startled from sleep, and made prisoners as they rushed forth in their
      confusion. A surrender accordingly took place.

      <p>
        The Fourth of July pranks of a young Ethan Allen and his
        friends—descendants of the Green Mountain Boys of Revolutionary days.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      ON THE evening of the third of July, somewhat more than fifty years ago, a
      number of boys were gathered in secret council at a deserted house on
      Otter Creek. The boys had come one by one in the gathering gloom of the
      early darkness, creeping along from bush to copse or hugging the shady
      side of the stone fences. They had come silently—no lilt of merry whistle
      or song, no wanton hoot or random stone-fling, had betrayed their presence
      on the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are nine of us already,” whispered a tall boy of fifteen as he
      shoved aside the hingeless door and peered out. “That is Seneca Goodyear
      coming across the meadow. He is strong if he does limp. Come in, Senk, and
      shut the door quick, hang your coat over the crack, and I’ll stand against
      the lower part. Now, Martin, let out your lantern—just a narrow slit of
      light and throw it on the floor—not in our faces. Go on, Ethan, and tell
      them about it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A heavy-shouldered boy with Saxon hair and eyes<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_118"
        >[118]</span
      >
      straightened himself up from the cobwebby wall against which he had been
      leaning and settled himself stolidly on his feet. This boy’s name was
      Ethan Allen and he was a descendant of the Revolutionary hero of the same
      name.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There isn’t much to tell,” he began. “The Ogden County boys have stolen
      our cannon—old ‘Ticonderoga’ that belongs to Hennepin County, that we have
      fired off every Fourth of July, or our folks have, ever since there was a
      Fourth of July. It has been stolen and carried across the county line, and
      in less than four hours they will be banging it in our faces from the top
      of Horncliffe. And we’ve got to get that gun between this and midnight.”
    </p>
    <p>“How are we going to do it?” asked Seneca Goodyear.</p>
    <p>“That is what we have got to find out,” said Ethan.</p>
    <p>
      “Why don’t the men do something about it?” asked a conservative boy. “I
      should think it ought to be settled by law; the gun was given to the
      county by Eth’s grandfather, and it is county property the same as
      everything else on the court-house grounds.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, it is county property,” said Seneca Goodyear. “And that is where the
      point lies. I’ve heard father talk about it. It is some kind of claim they
      set up on account of the new boundary line that has sliced off miles and
      miles of our county, and now they have got the ground they want everything
      that ever stood on the ground—their proportion of county property they
      call it, and they have begun by helping themselves to that gun. But
      there’s no right in their claim.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“Of course there’s not!”
      said one indignantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ogden County is the meanest lot that live on top of the State of Vermont
      anyway!” said another.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, the Ogden boys were smart enough to steal that gun,” said Ethan
      Allen, “and if Hennepin boys are any smarter we’d better show our stuff by
      getting it away from them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t take it to be any question of smartness,” answered the
      conservative boy. “It is quite as smart to keep out of a hornet’s nest as
      it is to get into it, and then fight out stung half to death. The question
      is, what are our chances for doing it? I’m not going on a fool’s errand.
      To begin with, who took the gun? Where did they take it to? Where is it
      now? And how do you know anything about it, anyway?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We have got all that straight enough, and here is the boy that will speak
      for himself. Come up here, Eph,” said Allen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus conjured, a boy arose from a dark corner and with a quick cat-like
      motion came to the front. He looked to be an artless little fellow of ten
      years, with his quiet eyes and his limp white locks hanging about his
      small face. But in truth he was fourteen years old, and the discipline of
      his life had made him shrewd and courageous. He showed very thin and
      imp-like as the ray of the lantern fell upon him. It seemed as if that
      sliver of light would go through him like a bayonet and come out on the
      other side.
    </p>
    <p>There was a murmur of voices. “Oh, him!”</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>“Eph Stearns—much he knows
      about it.”
    </p>
    <p>“Dodge down, you little white top, nobody wants to hear you!”</p>
    <p>
      But burly Ethan Allen shouldered up to the little fellow. “Go ahead, Eph,”
      he said, “tell it to ’em just as you told it to me. Don’t be scared.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I wa’n’t scared last night, and I ain’t likely to be now,” said Eph with
      a grin up at Ethan’s broad face.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s so. Shake hands. After all there is nothing little about you,
      Eph—except yourself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The little fellow looked bigger after this grip of good fellowship and he
      piped up and began his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was out last night,” he said. “It was near midnight I reckon. Most all
      the lights was out in the village and everything was quiet. I was out—out
      looking for something——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was out looking for his drunken old father,” whispered one of the
      boys, nudging his neighbor. “That’s Eph’s regular beat nights. He is
      afraid the old man will get run over, or get sunstruck by moonlight.”
    </p>
    <p>“Hush up, you,” said the boy addressed. “Eph isn’t to blame.”</p>
    <p>
      “I had been down by the cross-roads,” Eph went on. “You know where that
      is.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I think it’s likely we do—there is where General Stark buried a traitor
      and staked him down with a crowbar,” said one.
    </p>
    <p>
      “For some time I didn’t hear anything,” Eph went on.<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_121"
        >[121]</span
      >
      “Then I heard something coming along slow and still on the old turnpike.
      It didn’t seem like a wagon at first, nothing about it rattled and
      squeaked natural-like for a wagon. There must have been lots of axle
      grease onto them wheels and that harness was oiled up and strapped up, I
      tell you, and if them horses had a had smart-weed drafts onto their hoofs
      they couldn’t have set ’em down more soft and quiet-like. When I saw that
      it was a wagon and that there wa’n’t no signs of a driver to it—for
      whatever was driving of it was flat on the bottom—then it came over me
      that they was a-bringing home somebody dead in that wagon——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And the Remains was driving itself home, quiet and respectable-like, and
      conducting its own funeral—that’s accommodating now—I like that, go on,”
      interrupted Martin.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of course,” Eph admitted, looking a little “sheepish.” “Of course there
      wa’n’t no sense in that—not by daylight. But that’s what I thought of
      then, and I was hot and cold all to onct, I tell you, and I streaked after
      that wagon, for I meant to get home to mother ahead of it. I got up to the
      court house and lay down flat in that clump of pines by the horse block,
      ’cause all the roads branch off from there and I could see which way it
      went next. There wa’n’t no moon last night, and precious few stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      “On come the wagon, slow and steady—just as if a chunk of the dark had got
      loose from the rest of the dark and was moving on by itself. It come close
      to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> horse block and I
      could see it wa’n’t going down any of the roads. Then I heard a clattering
      sound, and I knew they were going over the round stones of the gutter, and
      the off horse struck out a spark with his hoof. When I saw ’em a-following
      me up so close I thought certain it was me they was after. But I had a
      good place for dodging—out by the meeting-house sheds, or down the
      court-house steps into the cellar, or round the wood pile—good places all
      of them, and I thought I would chance it. But there wa’n’t no call for
      dodging. The wagon just rolled quietly on a few steps and then stood
      stockstill and six black shadows rose up one by one and got out on to the
      ground, and when I saw that, why I could have squealed right out
      a-laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I meant to see what they were after, so I dragged myself along like a
      worm in the shadow of that bad-smelling green stuff that edges the
      driveway, and I found out they were boys from over the line and they had
      come for our gun. Phil Basset was bossing around—same as he tried to when
      he came to the academy before Ethan settled him. He was wheezing away like
      the croup, talking in big whispers full of wind, telling everybody else to
      keep still, and where to put the crowbars and how to lift all together
      when he give the word, one, two, three! But just as he got to ‘three,’
      there was a pin pointing toward the calf of his leg, and I braced myself
      against that pin and it naturally sent me off down the knoll, quiet-like
      and out of the way, and it left him hollering and kicking. Then
      everybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> dropped flat
      till they see whether any one in the village heard the noise. When they
      went to work again Phil said he’d been taken with cramp and couldn’t lift.
      But they got the gun onto the wagon and started for home. Phil drove
      ’cause his leg was lame and they was his father’s horses. The other five
      boys had gone on ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, when I saw that gun moving off, and I thought how that was ours for
      sure, and we’d got it from the English and how we’d got ourselves from the
      English—Fourth of July and all, so that they couldn’t ever boss us again,
      and so that everybody was his own boss in this country—why something rose
      up in my throat and choked me. Then I thought about Eth, ’cause he’d had
      charge of the gun, and he’d been awful good and let me help clean her up,
      and how we’d dug the rust out of her and greased her and polished her, and
      he’d showed me the powder and things for to-morrow and said I might touch
      her off the first bang—then I nearly busted, only I saw that it wasn’t any
      time for busting. I just got myself together pretty quick and jumped for
      the tailboard of that wagon. I hung on—I thought I’d stick to that gun,
      and if I died a sticking there, well then I’d die.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The boys had told Phil to take the new road to Tadman’s Ferry, ’cause the
      hills were so steep on the old one, and the fellows were to go cross-lots
      and meet him on the other side, and then they were going to set the gun up
      as high as they could get it on Horncliffe.<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_124"
        >[124]</span
      >
      But Phil said he reckoned he knew what the horses could haul, and as soon
      as he was left to himself he struck off onto the old road. He was up high
      on the seat and I’d crawled in and was laying on the bottom, flatter than
      flat—froze on to the gun. We buzzed along lively at first. The down-hills
      were rather shaky work you guess, but the up-hills were worse, and they
      kept getting more so till we got to that awful steep pitch near the top of
      Smith’s hill. You know where that is?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes,” said Martin. “There is where you have to lean backward to keep
      from bumping your forehead when you go up. I suppose you rose to the
      occasion, Eph—it must have stood you and the gun right up on end.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I got out,” Eph went on, “for the horses stood stockstill and couldn’t go
      an inch farther and then the wagon began to slip back, and Phil put stones
      back of the wheels. Then he went at his horses again, whipping and coaxing
      them. But it was no use. The road is slaty along there and the horses had
      no grip for their feet. He had to give it up at last and he left
      everything standing and went for the boys to get them to boost. As soon as
      I knew I was alone I hid the crowbars in a hollow tree, and I cut the
      traces and let the horses loose, and I took the linchpin out of one of the
      wheels—it wasn’t in very tight, and I took the ramrod of the gun, and I
      wrapped them traces around it and I dropped ’em into the brook at the
      foot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> of the hill. Then I
      put for home, and I waked up Ethan Allen and went to bed myself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I reckon you were in bed all the time, and saw all this with your eyes
      shut in the dark,” said a derisive voice.
    </p>
    <p>“Sure you didn’t dream it, Eph?” asked Seneca kindly.</p>
    <p>
      “It is a good yarn, anyway,” said Martin who had a taste for fancy
      sketches. “And it hangs together as well as most. I believe it is as true
      as any of us could make up unless we had facts or some little conveniences
      of that kind to go upon.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The little boy straightened up and leveled a look of indignant protest at
      the scoffers. Then, turning to Ethan Allen, he said, “You go on—you know
      about the rest of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No chaffing about this not being true,” said Ethan, “we haven’t the time
      for it. Eph wakened me up at two o’clock this morning with a handful of
      gravel on my window, and I was over at Smith’s hill before daylight, and I
      found the crowbars rammed up a hollow tree just as he told me, and the gun
      is there by the roadside, tipped over in a kind of gully, and there is
      some gravel on top of it, and a pile of dry brushwood, so that any one
      driving along the road would not notice it, and I fished the ramrod and
      old Basset’s traces out of the brook. I reckon the Ogden boys are coming
      over for the gun to-night, and we want to get in ahead of them. I can go,
      for one. Who else?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>“Me, too,” piped in little
      Eph.
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, of course,” said Ethan.</p>
    <p>“Me, three—that makes six,” said Martin.</p>
    <p>
      “I will go,” said Seneca Goodyear in his slow, heavy way, “and I reckon
      that father will let me have a team—our horses won’t have to work
      to-morrow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Will your father make you tell what you are going to do with it?” asked
      the conservative boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, no—not if I had rather not,” said Seneca. “He’ll trust me—and that
      is the tightest tether I want to be fastened with. Sometimes I wish he
      didn’t. I wouldn’t like to get home minus the traces and linchpin and
      crowbars as Phil Basset did.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, if Seneca goes, that takes me,” said Mark Hemingway, the tall
      doorkeeper. “My folks said I might stay all night with Seneca and I shall
      stick like a tick.”
    </p>
    <p>“I’ll go, and I, and I,” chorused the rest—conservative boy and all.</p>
    <p>
      Then Seneca Goodyear moved that Ethan Allan be captain of the expedition.
      This was carried by acclaim.
    </p>
    <p>
      “All right,” said Ethan in terse acceptance of the appointment. “Now we’ve
      got to be quicker than lightning and darker than thunder. We don’t want
      the Ogden boys to get there ahead of us, and have to fight them. No more
      we don’t want our folks stopping us nor helping us out as if we were
      babies. We want the glory of this ourselves. Quick and quiet is the
      word.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span> All scatter and get
      ready and we’ll meet at the cross-roads and start when the town clock
      strikes nine.”
    </p>
    <p>The company at the cross-roads organized as follows:</p>
    <p>Ethan Allen, captain.</p>
    <p>Eph Stearns, with the court-house mule, mounted scout.</p>
    <p>Martin Fox, with a dark lantern, spy and light skirmisher.</p>
    <p>
      Mark Hemingway, with an old triggerless flintlock of 1812, high private.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rank and file consisted of two boys with pistols and no cartridges,
      and three boys with doughnuts and sweet apples, while the conservative boy
      with a pocket-compass, a lead pencil, some string, and a chunk of
      shoemaker’s wax, put in a bid as topographer, correspondent, and surgeon.
      But Seneca Goodyear, with his stout team and wagon, well equipped with
      ropes, crowbars, skids, and other lifting apparatus, was the mainstay of
      the expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Eph Stearns was, for the nonce, a glorified being. Hitherto the
      heroisms of his life had been of the obscure and pathetic kind. Angels had
      inspired them, and a cloud of witnesses beheld them, but here the chance
      had come for a heroism brilliant and jubilant. Ethan Allen told him to go
      ahead and the big boys would see him do it. No wonder that he wrought
      marvels. Besides lassoing the mule, he had got a bag of shavings larger
      than himself, and a stout clothes line; the last two were for some secret
      service of his own suggestion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128"
        >[128]</span
      >
      though approved by the captain. But the mule seemed to be a purely
      ornamental feature of the occasion. He had been half-shoved, half-carried
      to the place of rendezvous; here he seemed unwilling to go any farther. He
      was hitched ignominiously to the tailboard of the wagon, and being pulled
      in front, and poked in the rear by his doughty rider who walked behind for
      this purpose, he moved off in spite of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away into the darkness of that quiet summer night the expedition passed
      on. The sleepy lights twinkled in the distant farmhouses, the dewy winds
      came over the meadows and grain fields, and the stars looked down from
      their solemn depths. The boys were rather quiet, for boys. The secrecy of
      the affair, the chances for a fight which might prove dangerous, the
      honorable and important character of the undertaking all conspired to give
      a sombre coloring to the occasion. These were veritable Green Mountain
      Boys, too, with the legends of heroic ancestry all aglow in their young
      hearts and the strength of their own hills in their sturdy purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a half-hour’s ride the boys reached the place and found everything
      all quiet. The gun was in bad shape, dislodged from the carriage and
      pitched into the gully. Nobody knew how to go at it and the darkness of
      the night added confusion to the situation. Now the Secret Service
      blazoned itself splendidly forth. Eph emptied his shavings on the ground
      in two piles, one or each side of the gun; upon these he heaped the
      brushwood and in less than two minutes he had two grand<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_129"
        >[129]</span
      >
      bonfires for the boys to work by. Then the little scout, with mule and
      clothes line, disappeared over the brow of the hill. A few rods below this
      point of vantage he stretched the clothes line across the road; it was
      about a foot from the ground and fastened on either side to the trunk of a
      tree. He then reported to his chief and received reinforcements: one boy
      and munitions of war—an empty bag, in which he gathered stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile at the gun the skids had been well adjusted by the firelight,
      and the lifting went sturdily on. Upon the height of the hill Eph awaited
      the onslaught of the enemy. The deploying force made a brave line of
      battle: Eph on the right flank with a pile of stones, his aide on the
      left, and the mule in the centre. They had not long to wait. A heavy team
      was heard laboring up. Moving shadows soon were seen in advance of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now don’t waste your stones,” Eph orders his command. “Don’t fire one of
      them till you see them Ogdens keel over the rope and hear them holler.
      Then pelt away like Jehu, and whoop like an Indian, and they’ll think it’s
      the regular army.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The enemy came on <i>en masse</i>, they tripped over the rope so
      beautifully that Eph Stearns, boy and man, has laughed at the thought of
      it ever since, they fell kicking and struggling and tangled up as to legs
      and arms. Rattle and whiz came the stones in showers upon them, and, to
      crown all, the mule cavorted right down into the thickest of the scrimmage
      as if he had been Job’s war-horse smelling the battle afar.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>It was full ten minutes
      before the Ogden boys got themselves together again, and during that ten
      minutes the last long pull and strong pull had been given to the cannon
      and the iron giant was rolling comfortably homeward in Seneca’s wagon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the boys hot, exultant, shouting, made a wild break for the enemy as
      they came pelting over the brow of the hill.
    </p>
    <p>“Sneaks!” calls one, with a stone.</p>
    <p>“Thieves!” yells another.</p>
    <p>“At ’em—fight ’em!” shouts another, brandishing a big stick.</p>
    <p>“Let’s lay ’em out! thrash ’em!”</p>
    <p>
      “Hold on! Halt!” cries Captain Ethan with the voice of a trumpet and he
      springs to the front of his little troop and faces them, his arms aloft
      with a kind of impassioned dominance of voice and mien that hustles back
      the pell-mell advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Halt! Form in line!” he calls, and the wild crowd sway into a kind of
      half-circle about their captain.
    </p>
    <p>“Three cheers for Hennepin County and the Gun!” orders the captain.</p>
    <p>
      Shout, shout, shout. Oh, how they shouted! That wild hurrah rifted the
      clouds and shook the mountains. Then as the echoes died away, in the sharp
      interval of silence that followed, Captain Ethan faced around to the
      enemy:
    </p>
    <p>“Now, gentlemen, what will you have?”</p>
    <p>“Three cheers for Ogden County!” returned the leader.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>“Ogden County—without the
      Gun, amen!” piped up Eph like a fife.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the three cheers were lustily given. The old Vermont hills echoed and
      re-echoed again, and a vast deal of spleen spent itself in those six
      cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, all hands!” commanded Captain Ethan Allen in ringing tones. “Now,
      both sides and everybody, give three cheers for the Green Mountain Boys
      and the Fourth of July!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, and doubly loud, roared out the great shouts. Again the mountains
      heard and the echoes reverberated around the sky. The stars listened, in
      their far heights, and knew that America was a stronger nation for the
      throb of patriotic feeling that pulsed through those hot young hearts and
      voiced itself in those fine huzzas.

      <p>
        Washington’s Birthday—boys skating—and how one timid little boy called
        after the Father of his Country lived up to his illustrious name.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      IT WAS the great misfortune of Tony Butler’s life to have been born on the
      twenty-second of February.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no comfort in reflecting that there were doubtless plenty of
      other boys in the country who labored under the same disadvantage. The
      other boys might perhaps be better fitted for the honor, but for poor Tony
      the distinction was a crushing one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first place, he had an older brother, and that older brother’s name
      was George. Now it is generally conceded that one of a name is enough for
      any family; but when Tony was born on the twenty-second of February, how
      was poor Mrs. Butler to act?
    </p>
    <p>
      Not to have called him after the Father of his Country would have been, in
      that good woman’s opinion, a positive slight to the illustrious dead. As
      long as her boy was fortunate enough to have the same birthday<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_139"
        >[139]</span
      >
      as our great President, it became her plain duty to give him one other
      point of resemblance, and then trust to time to complete the likeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a pity that they had a George already, but that difficulty could be
      done away with by calling her second son Washington. Washington Butler
      sounded well, and seemed all that was desirable; only there was just a
      little too much of it for every-day use. Sometimes the boy was called
      Washie, and sometimes Wash, and sometimes Wah, and sometimes Tony, until,
      as he grew older, and able to talk, he evinced a decided preference for
      the last title, and would answer to no other.
    </p>
    <p>
      But although this lessened his troubles it by no means ended them; for
      when a child has so many nicknames to choose from, everybody is apt to
      select a different one; and to confess the truth, he was not at all the
      right sort of a boy to be called George Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing of the soldier, nothing of the patriot, nothing at all
      remarkable, about poor Tony in any way. He was a shy, homely little boy,
      who would have passed well enough as plain Sam, which, being his father’s
      name, would also have been his had it not been for his unfortunate
      birthday. But as George Washington, even his doting mother was forced to
      realize he was not a complete success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first day he went to school the master sonorously read out his name as
      Antony Butler, whereat his brother giggled, and Tony, blushing fiery red,
      stammered out that he was not an Antony at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Not Antony?” said the
      teacher, in natural surprise. “Why, then, are you called Tony?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Because my name is George Washington, and we had a George already,” was
      the embarrassed answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this the boys with one accord dubbed him Washing Tony, as if he were
      a Chinese laundryman, and Washing Tony he continued to be called.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under these circumstances, perhaps he was excusable in wishing he had been
      born on some less illustrious day, and when the Twenty-second came duly
      around it required all the delights of a new pair of skates and a fur cap
      to reconcile him entirely to his fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being a general holiday, all the boys proposed spending it on the ice,
      and Tony could skate a great deal better than he could write or cipher;
      although even here he was never what boys consider brave, and what their
      parents are apt to more accurately define as foolhardy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, there was not in the child a spice of that boyish daring
      which seems so attractive in its possessor, and which is in reality so
      wanton and useless.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tony never wanted to climb high trees, or jump from steep places, or pat a
      restive horse, or throw an apple at a cross old farmer. All these things,
      which were dear to the hearts of his companions, were totally unattractive
      to him. He could never be dared to any deed that had a touch of danger in
      it, and the contrast between his prudent conduct and his illustrious title
      was, in the eyes of all the other boys, the crowning absurdity of the
      case.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>On this particular
      birthday the weather, though clear, was mild for the season, and some
      apprehension had been felt as to the complete soundness of the ice. A
      careful investigation, however, showed it to be all firm and solid except
      in one corner, where the lake was deepest, and where the ice, though
      unbroken, looked thin and semi-transparent, with the restless water
      underneath. Around this uncertain quarter a line was drawn, and soon some
      thirty or forty boys were skimming rapidly over the frozen surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fred Hazlit and Eddy Barrows were the champion skaters of the district,
      and their evolutions were regarded with wonder and delight by a host of
      smaller boys, who vainly tried to rival their achievements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not so Tony. Although perfectly at home on the ice, he seemed to have no
      more desire to excel here than elsewhere, but skated gravely up and down,
      enjoying himself in his sober fashion, his cap drawn over his eyes, his
      little red hands thrust in his overcoat pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      George, who did not think this at all amusing, was off with the older
      boys, trying to write his name on the ice, and going over and over it with
      a patient persistency that, practised at school, would have made him the
      first writer in his class.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the forbidden ground began to be encroached on, some of the
      older boys skimming lightly over it, and finding it quite hard enough to
      bear their weight. Soon the line was obliterated by a dozen pairs<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_142"
        >[142]</span
      >
      of skates, and the children, never heeding it, spread themselves over
      every inch of ice on the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      All but Tony. With characteristic prudence he had marked the dangerous
      corner well, and never once ventured upon it. As he stopped to tighten his
      skates, four of the younger boys, hand in hand, came bearing down upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Catch hold,” shouted Willie Marston, “and we’ll make a line. Hurrah! Here
      goes!” and Tony with the rest shot across the smooth sheet of ice until
      they came to the inclosed quarter. The others were keeping right on, but
      Tony stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>“It is not safe,” he said, “and I am not going on it.”</p>
    <p>
      “Nonsense!” cried Dick Treves. “What a coward you are, Tony! We have been
      over it a dozen times already this morning, and it is just as safe as the
      rest.”
    </p>
    <p>“Of course it is,” said Willie. “Come ahead.”</p>
    <p>
      But Tony did not go ahead. Neither did he discuss the matter, for argument
      of any kind was not at all in his way. He merely stopped and let go of
      Willie’s hand. “It isn’t safe,” he persisted. “You can do as you like, but
      I am not going on it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, stay there,” said Ned Marston, giving him a little shove—“stay
      where you are, General Washington, and cross the Delaware on dry land if
      you can.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Three cheers for General Washington!” shouted Dick derisively. “Hurrah
      for the bravest of the brave!” and then the three boys skated on, leaving
      Tony standing there upon the ice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>His face flushed crimson
      with shame, but he never stirred. He hated to be laughed at and called a
      coward, but he was afraid to venture, and no amount of ridicule could urge
      him on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly he turned to go when at that instant an ominous sound struck his
      ear. The treacherous ice was cracking in all directions, a dozen jagged
      seams spreading like magic over the smooth surface. There was a sharp
      snap, a cry of terror, a splash, and three boys, white with fright,
      started back from the yawning hole barely in time to save themselves from
      falling.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the excitement and fear of that moment no one of them thought of his
      companion; but Tony, who stood beside, had seen poor Willie’s despairing
      blue eyes fixed on him with a mute appeal for help as he staggered and
      fell into the dark water.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somehow all his habitual caution, which was so falsely termed cowardice,
      had disappeared; he never even thought of being afraid, with that pitiful
      glance still before his eyes, but, urged on by some great impulse, cleared
      the space between them in an instant, and plunged down after his drowning
      friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another minute and both boys re-appeared, Willie clutching fiercely at his
      preserver, and Tony holding him off as well as he could with one arm while
      he struck out bravely with the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but the work of a moment before help reached them, but that moment
      had saved poor Willie’s life, and changed forever the opinions of the
      school.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>They had learned what true
      courage was. Tony Butler might be timid and insignificant, but he had
      proved himself beyond a doubt worthy of his illustrious name, and a fit
      hero for the Twenty-second.

      <p>
        A good, long boy’s story of how three Philadelphia lads spent an
        exciting Christmas at Valley Forge, after performing a service of great
        value to the patriots’ cause.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h3>I</h3>
    <p class="drop-cap">THIS is a story of a boy and two other boys.</p>
    <p>
      Tom Markham was fifteen and over, and was careful when asked his age to
      say he was in his sixteenth year. His brothers were two years younger.
      When Harry was asked how old he was he said he was as old as Bill, and
      when any one inquired his age of Bill he replied that he was as old as
      Harry. This was because being twins they got somehow mixed up when they
      were born, and no one knew which was ten minutes the older.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between themselves the twins considered the matter of precedence based on
      age as important, and now and then endeavored to adjust matters by wager
      of battle. It was settled at last by the elder brother, Tom, who decided
      that they should be elder year about. Thus, in 1777 Bill was the older,
      and was sadly regarding the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146"
        >[146]</span
      >
      lapse into youth which was about to come in 1778, when Harry would be in
      turn the senior.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Tom, who was to be sixteen in February, looked older, his brothers
      appeared younger than their years, and were two saucy, clever, reckless
      lads. A look of child-like innocence was part of the protective capital
      the twins invested in mischief. They fought one another, made common cause
      against the world, and had, as concerned Tom, a certain amount of respect
      founded on physical conditions. At the close of this year 1777, Sir
      William Howe held the city of Penn with some eighteen thousand men. Twenty
      miles away George Washington waited in his lines at Valley Forge with
      three or four thousand half-starved soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the two armies Nature had established a nearly neutral ground, for
      on it lay the deepest snow the land had known for many a year. It was both
      foe and friend to the Continental soldiers, whom starvation and cold were
      daily tempting to desertion, and among whom disease in many forms was
      busily recruiting for the army of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The well-fed British regulars in and near the city found in the snow an
      obstacle which forbade Sir William Howe to move, discouraged enterprise,
      and gave excuses for inertness, since no general at that time ventured to
      think of a winter campaign, until in ’78 the Virginia general read his
      enemy a novel lesson in the art of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The land between the city of Philadelphia and Valley<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_147"
        >[147]</span
      >
      Forge on both sides of the Schuylkill was in ’77 a fertile country of
      large farms to which narrow wood roads led from the main highways. On to
      this region of winter, scouting or foraging parties of both armies
      ventured at times, and from it in good weather the farmers, despite the
      efforts of our scant cavalry, took supplies to the snow-beleaguered city,
      and sometimes, if Tories, information of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the best houses of the city there were quartered, to the disgust of the
      Whig dames, a great number of British officers. They were to be fed
      without charge and were unpleasant or not personally disagreeable, as
      chanced to be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Markham’s ample house on Third Street, near Spruce, had its share of
      boarders thus comfortably billeted, to the satisfaction of her Tory
      neighbors who were not thus burdened or who gladly entertained officers of
      distinction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the house, Colonel Markham, of the Continental line, lay a
      prisoner in New York, when on Christmas Eve, in this year of 1777, Mrs.
      Markham and three unwelcome guests sat down to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom, the elder son, stood at the window watching the big white snowflakes
      flitting across the black squares of the night-darkened panes.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come, my son,” said Mrs. Markham, and he took the vacant seat, his mind
      on the joys to which the weather was contributing in the way of coasting,
      skating, and snowball wars.
    </p>

      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>This terrible winter was
      one thing to Sir William Howe, another to George Washington, and a quite
      delightful other to Tom Markham. “I suppose, Tom,” said the mother, as he
      took his seat, “this sort of Christmas weather is much to your liking.”
    </p>
    <p>“Why, any fellow would like it, mother.”</p>
    <p>
      “There is everything in the point of view,” she returned, smiling. “I have
      no recollection of a winter like this.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In truth, the weather was keeping Christmas with a bountiful gift of fresh
      snow to the earth which was already heavily burdened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within the house a cheerful wood-fire blazed on the hearth. Two branched
      silver candelabra lighted the table, and the furniture, portraits, and
      round mirrors all told of ease and luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have to thank you for the turkey, Captain Verney,” said Mrs. Markham.
      “My supplies are running low and soon you will be no better fed than the
      Continentals.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Rebels, madam,” said Colonel Grimstone, a rough, red-faced soldier, who
      had risen from the ranks. “I think we shall have to be fed and well fed,
      too. I have asked five officers to dine here next week, on New Year’s
      Day.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom looked straight at the fat Colonel and wished he were himself a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      “By that time,” said Mrs. Markham, laughing, “you will have little besides
      pork and potatoes; Heaven knows what else.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>“Oh, you will find us
      enough. All you rebel ladies tell the same story. A bit tough, this
      mutton.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time she broke into angry reply. “Then, sir, it is like your
      manners—hard to digest.”
    </p>
    <p>
      What with care and anxiety, she had come to the place where open wrath is
      the only escape from the shame of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      To her surprise the Colonel made no rejoinder. The younger officer at his
      side caught his eye as he was about to make some insolent reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain, the Honorable John Verney, to be some day in the peerage if
      spared by war, was a person whom the Colonel did not care to offend, and
      who, as Mrs. Markham spoke, said, “You had better get another billet,
      Grimstone. No doubt André would exchange with you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel growled but held his tongue, knowing very well that few
      officers were as well cared for as Mrs. Markham’s guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Verney, a gentleman of the best, smiled at her and nodded reassuringly. He
      meant, as often before, to set her at ease as to her difficulty in suiting
      the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third guest, a Hessian officer, Count Von Einstein, annoyed by the
      Colonel’s rudeness, turned the talk aside as he said, in fair English:
      “The letter you gave me for your husband in New York I was able to forward
      but I had first to go through the form of reading it: I think I did say
      so; else it could not have gone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>“Of course,” returned Mrs.
      Markham, coloring. “Is there any chance of exchange of prisoners?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I fear not,” said Verney, “unless the Continentals should capture the
      Count or Colonel Grimstone.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “There isn’t much chance of that, mother,” whispered Tom. “They like town
      too well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hush!” she said, but smiled at him affectionately. Amid the stress of
      war, the talk at table, and his mother’s anxiety, the lad had become
      thoughtful beyond his years. “What a terrible night!” said Mrs. Markham,
      as the wind roared around the house and the casements rattled. Her mind
      was on the camp at Valley Forge, whence came, from the Quaker farmers, now
      and then, tales of starvation, misery, and desertion very encouraging to
      Sir William Howe, who felt that there was small need to assist the weather
      in fighting his battles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some such thought was in the mind of the Colonel, for he remarked, “The
      rebels must be enjoying it.”
    </p>
    <p>“There are two sides to that question,” replied Verney.</p>
    <p>“How two, sir?” asked Grimstone.</p>
    <p>
      “Oh, we cannot move,” said the Count. “Not even the great Frederick ever
      made a campaign in winter.”
    </p>
    <p>“Who wants to move? I do not,” growled the Colonel.</p>
    <p>“I would try it, if I were Sir William.”</p>
    <p>“And how?” asked the Colonel.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>“Well, this way,” said
      Verney.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and taking a sheet of paper from a desk near by sat down again
      and rapidly drew the course of the river Schuylkill. “This way. March five
      thousand men up each side of the river, cross on the ice from this side,
      and attack on both sides at once.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count looked up. “That is just what Major Montresor is urging Sir
      William to do, and at once. He hesitates——”
    </p>
    <p>“But the snow,” said the Colonel.</p>
    <p>“He won’t try it,” returned Verney.</p>
    <p>
      “No, thank Heaven,” said the Colonel, and the sketch was crumpled up and
      cast aside to fall on the floor under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper was over, the table cleared, and the men sat talking together. At
      this time broke in the twins, beating off the snow and pounding with their
      cold feet on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>“I have a sword,” and “I have a drum,” cried the twins.</p>
    <p>“Goodness, you little rebels! I shall run,” laughed Verney.</p>
    <p>“And I,” cried the Count.</p>
    <p>“You are late, boys,” said Mrs. Markham.</p>
    <p>“Aunt Mary kept us.”</p>
    <p>“Did you put away the lantern?”</p>
    <p>“No, mother,” said Bill.</p>
    <p>
      “Why not? I told you to be careful of it. What mischief have you been up
      to? I shall be easier when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
      the holidays are over and the schoolmaster is busy with his ferrule.”
    </p>
    <p>The twins looked at each other and were silent.</p>
    <p>“Come,” said Verney, “out with it, boys.”</p>
    <p>“You’re the oldest, Harry,” said Bill.</p>
    <p>“Out with it, Gemini,” said Verney.</p>
    <p>Harry was silent, and it was Bill who replied.</p>
    <p>
      “Well, Sambo—that’s Aunt Mary’s man, sir—he wouldn’t let us carry the
      lantern.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Verney, the sympathetic lover of all their mischief, asked, “What then,
      Bill?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “We kicked his shins and he dropped the lantern and it went out, and a
      soldier came along and he said we had no lantern and he must take Sambo to
      the Guardhouse.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Verney, much amused, said: “You young rebels are always in mischief. The
      orders of Mr. Galloway are that every one after dark must carry a
      lantern.”
    </p>
    <p>“Well, we wanted to carry it.”</p>
    <p>“What did Sambo say?”</p>
    <p>
      “He ran away when the soldier said he had no light. Then we ran, too, like
      everything.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And was that all?” The twins hesitated. “Oh, don’t be afraid,” cried
      Verney. “What next?”
    </p>
    <p>“We hurrahed for Washington and snowballed him.”</p>
    <p>“What, Washington?”</p>
    <p>
      “No, sir, the soldier; and he ran after us and we ran down Willings Alley
      and got over the wall and then over our own wall, and that soldier-man he
      is asking questions of Mr. Willing’s cook.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>Tom grinned approval, the
      Count looked serious, and Verney laughed while the Colonel said, “I have a
      mind to spank both of you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Markham turned on him. “I can attend to those ceremonies myself,
      sir”—a fact of which the twins were well aware.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel made no reply, but Verney said: “In the interest of
      patriotism, madam, you cannot possibly court-martial them.”
    </p>
    <p>“And it is Christmas Eve, mother,” said Tom.</p>
    <p>
      “Well, it is largely your fault, Mr. Verney. You spoil them too much.”
    </p>
    <p>“I shall reform, madam. We shall reform, Gemini.”</p>
    <p>“To bed with you, lads,” she said.</p>
    <p>“Couldn’t we sit up a little?” said Verney.</p>
    <p>“Please, madam,” urged the Count.</p>
    <p>
      “Then half an hour. Come to the fire. Lie down on the rug, boys. Why, your
      hands are half frozen.” The Count and Verney drew to the hearth and the
      Colonel sat at the table. He was quite outside of the group around the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You have been so good,” said Verney, “that I shall have some little
      presents for you to-morrow.” The twins wished to hear of them. “No,” he
      said, “you must wait.” But in the morning he and the Colonel had to go out
      to inspect the works Major Montresor had thrown up at Chestnut Hill. They
      would use their own horses and Mrs. Markham’s sleigh, and would their
      mother let the boys go?
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>“They are so good,” said
      Verney.
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, do, mother!” cried the twins.</p>
    <p>
      The Colonel at the table growled that children were in the way, nuisances;
      but Verney took his assent for granted, and somewhat reluctantly the
      mother yielded, her friend Verney promising to take care of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom liked very well this chance to see the soldiers, but showed the
      growing boy’s usual appearance of being unenthusiastic. Moreover, he hated
      the Colonel as much as he liked Verney.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assured of the frolic, the twins frankly opened the question of Christmas
      presents with their friendly German guest, Mrs. Markham protesting in
      vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count laughed. “<i>Guter himmel</i>, children. I have no presents. Ask
      the Colonel; he might dream you each a pony.” The Colonel by this time was
      sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s no use,” said Harry.</p>
    <p>
      “Not even if he was awake,” said Bill. “If you haven’t got any presents,
      tell us a story.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This he had done many times, liking the lads. Now at this Christmas season
      he was thinking of his distant home and his wife and children, away in the
      Fatherland.
    </p>
    <p>“Come, come, Count,” said Verney; “I like stories.”</p>
    <p>The Count sat still, reflecting.</p>
    <p>“He’s getting ready,” said Harry.</p>
    <p>“It will be a Christmas story, boys.”</p>
    <p>
      “By all means,” said Verney, seeing as he spoke the old Devonshire
      hall—his home, the holly and the mistletoe,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_155"
        >[155]</span
      >
      and hearing the merriment that seemed to sail to him on fairy ships over
      three thousand miles of sea. They would drink his health this night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was recalled to a sense of his alien surroundings as the Count said:
      “This is a story, boys, my father used to tell when I was a little fellow,
      but it was never told except on Christmas Eve when we sat in the great
      hall of my own home.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What made you come away to fight us?” This was Bill’s contribution. Harry
      punched him to emphasize his wish that there should be no interruptions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Markham did not, as usual, reprove the twin whose ingenious capacity
      to unite impertinence and curiosity was in great need of check. She merely
      looked up at the Hessian gentleman, who gravely made reply to Bill: “I am
      a soldier and go where I am ordered, even though it take me to death.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The twins discussed this later, but Tom was old enough to note the
      suddenly serious look of the officer as Mrs. Markham, who knew his
      history, said: “Be quiet, boys. I want to hear the story, even if you do
      not.”
    </p>
    <p>“But we do,” cried the twins.</p>
    <p>
      “When I tell this story I think of the great hall of the castle, with no
      light but what the big logs gave, and how it flashed red on the armor and
      on the lances and swords on the walls.”
    </p>
    <p>“Why must there be no lights?” asked Harry.</p>
    <p>
      “Because we think in Hesse that at midnight when<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_156"
        >[156]</span
      >
      the blessed day is just born the Christ comes to the door and blesses the
      home. As He is the light of the world there must be no other light but the
      fire for warmth, like the comforting of His love for all, all of us. But
      now I must not be interrupted.”
    </p>
    <p>“If Bill does it again,” said the other twin, “I will——”</p>
    <p>“Just you try,” returned Bill.</p>
    <p>“I shall thrash you both,” said Tom.</p>
    <p>“You can’t!”</p>
    <p>
      On this the mother said they should all three go to bed if they spoke a
      word in the next half-hour. Upon this there was silence and only the
      occasional interchange of such warlike signals as are well known to boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count went on, the three lads now eagerly attentive, while Verney sat
      by giving at need a faint whistle to check or lower the fine snoring of
      the Colonel.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Once upon a time in old days there was a King, and the time it was once
      upon was Christmas Eve. Then, as was the custom, Rathumus, the maker of
      stories for the King, came to him and said, ‘Come with me that under the
      stars I tell you the Christmas tale.’ The King went with him into the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘This,’ said the teller of tales, ‘O King, is the night of all nights
      that brings to men wise counsel for their own birthdays, when kings who
      are merciful set free many who are in prison for debt.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “‘But now in this kingdom on the birthday of the<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_157"
        >[157]</span
      >
      Christ, the King of Kings, a hundred couriers sit on their horses at the
      gate waiting for a message of pardon and release to all who are in prisons
      for wrong-doing or for having displeased my lord the King. This is the law
      of the land. But if the King in his wrath has one he will not set free,
      then none are released, and the couriers ride sad to the homes of those
      who bide in sorrow.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “On this the maker of stories went away and the King stayed alone in the
      garden. It was very quiet and the stars watched him to see what would
      come, for now it was near to midnight, and over all the land many who knew
      of the custom stood at their doors longing to see the white-robed couriers
      arrive with news of pardon on that Christmas Day.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now there is always for every man some woman of whom he is afraid, and so
      it was with the King. It was not the Queen, because she was dead, but it
      was the King’s daughter, who wanted to marry a brave young Prince, and was
      angry because the King saw no way to prevent it except to keep him shut up
      in a high tower.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The stars all felt sorry when the King cried out, ‘Never will I let him
      out—never!’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then a little wind sobbed through the trees and was still and the roses
      in the shadows prayed and the nightingales ceased to sing. There was a
      great quietness.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The King sat down on a seat and was angry with the custom and with
      himself, and shut his eyes and thought, for now he must decide. If he
      would not set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> free the
      Prince there would be no Christmas prayers for him in all the wide land.
      But no, he would not free the Prince.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of a sudden he heard a voice say softly: ‘If, O King, you move you will
      surely die. Listen!’ Then he looked and saw in the darkness a dim figure
      with great white wings and was afraid, and as he listened he heard: ‘O
      King, around the throne of God a million courier angels are waiting in
      prayer. And at the noon of night the Christ will speak, and they will fly
      to set loose from chains of sin those who have this year offended a
      greater King than you. Hark, the clock strikes! They are on their way to
      open for you and many the prison doors of cruelty and wrong-doing.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Of a sudden the angel was gone and the nightingales sang again, while the
      King went to the gate and cried to the couriers, ‘Go, with my pardon.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then in the palace the Princess said to her ladies: ‘Quick, take off my
      swan wings and never tell what I have done, or none of you shall ever be
      married.’
    </p>
    <p>“Very soon came the King, and said, ‘I have seen an angel!’</p>
    <p>
      “And so the Prince was set free and married that clever Princess and was
      ever after good and happy.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      “What a pretty tale!” said Mrs. Markham; “and now to bed, to bed, boys.”
    </p>
    <p>“Thank you, sir,” said Tom.</p>
    <p>Bill was silent.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>“Then it wasn’t a real
      angel,” said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, it was,” laughed Verney. “It was a woman.”</p>
    <p>
      On this Harry, who had the gift of imagination, got up and kissed his
      mother, who, comprehending him, smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as they were going noisily to bed a servant came in and said an
      orderly was without. He gave a paper to Verney, who awakened the Colonel
      and gave him a letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel rubbed his eyes and looked at it. “I hoped they had forgotten.
      Here are our orders to inspect the lines to-morrow on Mount Airy and
      Chestnut Hill.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And here,” said Verney, “is Montresor’s map of the forts in and about the
      city. He promised me to send it as a guide to the outlying works.” The
      twins having gone, Tom lingered, unnoticed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me see that map,” said the Colonel. They spread it on the table and
      began to consider it.
    </p>
    <p>“May I look?” asked Tom, as usual curious.</p>
    <p>
      “Certainly,” said Verney. “I will explain it to you. See, here are
      bastions and these dots the cannon. Here is the <i>tête du pont</i>, a
      work to defend the upper ferry.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is rather droll to me,” said Count Einstein. “Eighteen thousand men
      ought to be bastions enough.”
    </p>
    <p>“Not for Sir William,” laughed Verney.</p>
    <p>“It is Montresor’s own copy,” said Grimstone. “It is signed.”</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>“I should be pretty
      careful of it,” said the Count, a brave and well-trained soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      This readiness to explain the plans to Mrs. Markham and her interested boy
      seemed to him unwise. More than once full knowledge of contemplated army
      movements had in some mysterious way reached the snowbound enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Markham stood by looking over Tom’s shoulder, and presently said, “It
      is quite incomprehensible to me. Do you understand it, Tom?”
    </p>
    <p>“I think so. See, mother, in one place he marks a weak point.”</p>
    <p>
      “Have you, Mr. Verney, any such plans of the lines at Valley Forge?” she
      asked gaily.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You had better inquire of Major Montresor,” said the Count, not fancying
      the too-free talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      “To exchange plans would simplify matters,” said Mrs. Markham, from whom
      it is to be feared the twins inherited their capacity for mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count, much the ablest of the three officers, looked up at her of a
      sudden grave. Tom, always on easy terms with Verney, went on eagerly
      asking intelligent questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is time, my son, you went to bed,” said the mother. “If George
      Washington, Count, could make no more of that tangle of lines than I, you
      might safely make him a Christmas gift of it.”
    </p>
    <p>“Let him come and get it,” laughed Verney.</p>
    <p>
      “They are pretty poor with their Continental rag<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_161"
        >[161]</span
      >
      money,” growled Grimstone, “but I suppose that map would easily fetch——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fetch!” broke in the Count, still less relishing the talk. “It wouldn’t
      fetch five shillings.” There was an unusually sharp note in his voice.
      “Roll it up, Verney.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the senior officer present, and Verney, at once recognizing the
      implied rebuke as something like an order, took the hint, saying, as he
      rolled the map, “I wanted to ask you if you thought——”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count put a hand on his shoulder with the slight pressure which gave
      force to his words as he said: “We will talk of it, sir, another time.
      Permit me to say that if I were you I should be careful of that map.” This
      was in an aside to Verney as the boy left them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among them they had set the adventurous mind of a fearless young rebel to
      thinking in a fashion of which they little dreamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I shall be careful, sir,” and then with his gay manner and the
      self-confidence of youth, he added: “What with the Gemini and Tom and the
      Colonel, it ought to be safe enough. What time should we go to-morrow,
      Colonel?”
    </p>
    <p>“Nine will be early enough.”</p>
    <p>“Will you lend me your sable coat?” asked Verney of the Count.</p>
    <p>“With pleasure.”</p>
    <p>
      “I like best my sealskin,” said Grimstone. “It is not so heavy. Do you
      really mean to take the boys?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>“Of course I do. We want
      Tom to hold the horses while we tramp about, and the Gemini must have the
      frolic. I promised.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom listened, well pleased. He paused on his way to bed, and while the
      officers were studying Major Montresor’s elaborate map, he pocketed the
      rough sketch of attack Verney had crumpled up and cast under the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was by this time more than merely curious. Being intelligent and
      thoughtful, all this war talk interested him, and now for two years his
      father’s letters while in service and the constant discussion he heard had
      rendered familiar the movements of the two armies and the changing
      fortunes of the war. The great value of the map of Sir William’s chief
      engineer had been made plain to him, and his mother’s gay suggestion that
      it would be a nice Christmas gift to Washington set the lad to planning
      all manner of wild schemes as he lay abed. He finally gave it up in
      despair. How could a boy manage to steal a map from a man like Verney and
      then get to Valley Forge? It was no use to bother about it, and he went to
      sleep.
    </p>
    <h3>II</h3>
    <p>
      The boys were up early, overjoyed to see a brilliant, sunshiny day. Mrs.
      Markham provided an ample luncheon, and with Verney and the Colonel in
      front of the sleigh, and the twins and Tom well muffled up on<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_163"
        >[163]</span
      >
      the back seat, the party sped away, the snow creaking under the runners.
      The twins talked, laughed, and sang, while Tom sat still, thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      They paused again and again in Germantown and beyond it to inspect
      positions or to talk to officers. At Chestnut Hill they drove down the
      westward slope and finally came upon the farther picket line below the
      hill. Verney, an engineer officer, thought a field work was needed at this
      point. Accordingly, the two officers got out, leaving their fur overcoats
      in the sleigh, as the air was now warmer and they had to tramp some
      distance through the heavy drifts of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel put Montresor’s map in the pocket of his fur coat, which he
      folded and laid in the sleigh. Verney also left the Count’s rich sable at
      the feet of the twins.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We shall be gone half an hour, boys,” said Verney. “Had we not better
      call a corporal from the fire yonder to stand by the horses?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Lord, man,” said Grimstone, “they would stand till night. They are dead
      tired. Won’t you want the map?”
    </p>
    <p>“No,” said Verney; “I know it by heart.”</p>
    <p>
      About a hundred yards distant was a great campfire and just ahead of them
      an outlying picket of two soldiers, one on each side above the road. Tom
      sat on the front seat, the reins in his hand. Of a sudden a mad idea came
      into his mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      The map was in the sleigh. The two officers were<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_164"
        >[164]</span
      >
      far away, tramping through the drifts. Before him lay the lonely highway.
      He would take the map to Washington. He forgot the peril of the mad
      venture now tempting him, or gave it but a boy’s passing thought. His
      summers had been spent at a farm near White Marsh. He knew the country
      well. The temptation was too much for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man would have realized the difficulties and the danger for the smaller
      boys. He did not. A boy’s mind is more simple. The risks for himself were
      merely additional temptations.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood up, the reins in his hand, and gazed anxiously after the
      retreating forms of the two officers. Then he turned to his brothers.
    </p>
    <p>“Get over in front, Bill; quick, and don’t make a noise.”</p>
    <p>
      There was mischief in the air as Bill at once knew. He climbed over the
      seat and waited.
    </p>
    <p>“Hold fast, Harry,” said Tom. “These horses are going to run away.”</p>
    <p>“Oh, let me out,” cried Harry.</p>
    <p>“No, hold on, and keep quiet.”</p>
    <p>“What fun!” cried Bill. “We are to have a ride all to ourselves.”</p>
    <p>
      “Do you whack the horses, Bill. They’ll go. Wait a moment.” He gave one
      last look around him and ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the picket the road ran straight for a mile. He had his moment of
      final hesitation, but it was soon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165"
        >[165]</span
      >
      over. No one was in sight near by, and his eyes roamed over the trackless
      vacancy of snow-clad spaces into which the highway disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>“Are you ready, Bill?” he said, handing him the whip.</p>
    <p>
      “All right,” said Bill, seeing desirable mischief ahead and enjoying the
      prospect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry was less eager, but, ashamed to confess his fears, said bravely,
      “Well, Tom, hurry up.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Tom, “do you, Bill, hit the horses with the whip, not too
      hard. They’ll go.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They did go, for Bill, enchanted, had to be stopped. In an instant they
      were off and away at a mad gallop over a much-used road.
    </p>
    <p>“By George!” roared the Colonel. “The horses have run away!”</p>
    <p>
      The soldiers shouted, the picket ran down to the road, too late, and
      furious at this unwonted treatment the horses ran. A mile or more went by
      before the heavy snowdrifts of a less-used road lessened their speed. On a
      hillcrest Tom stood up and looked back.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Guess we are safe, boys,” he said. “It’s good there were no horses
      about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As the sleigh moved more slowly at a trot, Bill said, “It was a
      first-class runaway!” and Harry, reassured, asked if it wasn’t time for
      lunch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom said no, and kept his eye on the road, which by one o’clock became
      hard for the horses, as the drifts were heavier.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>At last he pulled up for
      luncheon and to rest the team. As the twins were now pretty cold Tom got
      out the fur coats.
    </p>
    <p>“There are only two,” said Harry.</p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I’ll fix that,” said Tom. And this was his way: he threw the heavy
      sable coat over the boys’ shoulders, and while Harry put his right hand
      into the right sleeve Bill put his left hand into the left sleeve. When
      Tom had them buttoned up, the two red faces being close together in the
      middle, he called them a double-headed bear and roared with laughter as he
      himself put on the Colonel’s coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Won’t he say things!” said Bill, and they went on, but now only at a
      walk. Harry did not like it, but, ashamed to confess his fears, kept
      quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They met no one. The distant farms were hidden by the snow-laden forests.
      The drifts became heavier. Now they were off the road and now on. There
      were no marks of recent travel. It was Christmas; the farmers at home.
      Both the twins had become silent, Tom more and more anxious as he missed
      his well-known landmarks. At last a dead tree on the road let him know
      that he was about six miles from the Forge. The horses had come quite nine
      miles or more through tiring drifts. Now and then their feet balled and
      Tom had to get down and beat out the packed snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the horses could do no more than walk. It was well on to four
      o’clock, but at this he could only guess. He began to be troubled about
      the twins and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span> a little to
      regret having made his venture. If they came to a stop with no house in
      sight, what could he do? To walk to the camp would be even for him hard
      and for the twins impossible. Again he stopped the horses for a rest, a
      formidable drift lying ahead and filling the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time Bill had lost much of the joy of mischievous adventure. He
      began to think it was time for them to return home, and Harry had asked
      over and over how soon they would go back. Tom at length ceased to answer
      him as it drew toward evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a new sharpness in the air, a warning to Tom of what night would
      bring. He stood upon the seat and searched the white-clad land for a house
      or the wood opening which might lead to one. He saw no sign of habitation
      to which he could go in person for help. And how could he leave his
      brothers? Even to turn homeward in the narrow road among the drifts would
      have been, as he saw, quite out of the question. What else was there but
      to go on?
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at this worst minute of his daring adventure the boy could have cried
      at the thought of failure. He felt the map and Verney’s sketch under his
      waistcoat, thought of his father, a prisoner, and then cheering up the
      twins, used the whip on the weary horses, who plunged into the great mound
      of snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      A trace snapped, the sleigh turned over on its side, the horses kicked,
      broke loose, and fled away down the road and were soon lost to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Tom got on his feet and
      looked for the twins. For a moment they were out of sight. Then the huge
      drift began to shake and their four legs were seen kicking above the snow,
      whence Tom pulled out the two-headed bear. Bill laughed. Tom did not.
      Harry looked his alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      All three working hard were able to right the sleigh after beating away a
      part of the drift. After that they climbed in and ate what was left of the
      food, but were not quite so merry as before, while Tom, made savage by
      failure, would neither eat nor talk.
    </p>
    <p>At last he stood up on the seat.</p>
    <p>
      “Shut up, Gemini,” he said, “I hear something. Now,” he said, turning,
      “mind you, if these I hear are British we were run away with. Hush!” He
      heard in the sharp, frosty air the clink of sabres and soon the thud of
      horses’ hoofs in the snow.
    </p>
    <h3>III</h3>
    <p>
      A moment after the runaway boys had heard the sound of horses in the snow,
      a dozen troopers of the Continental army were around them and a young
      officer rode up, while Harry whimpered and said, “Now we’ll be killed.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Great George!” cried the officer, “but here’s a queer capture. Who the
      deuce are you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am Tom Markham, sir. My father is Colonel Markham, and these are my
      brothers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>When Allan McLane saw the
      two-headed bear he rocked with laughter as he sat in his saddle.
    </p>
    <p>“And how did you get here?”</p>
    <p>
      “We ran away with the horses of Colonel Grimstone and Captain Verney, and,
      sir, this was why we ran away.” As he spoke he pulled out Montresor’s map
      and the sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane opened the paper. “By George, it’s Montresor’s own map. How did you
      get it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “They left it in the sleigh while they went to look at something this side
      of Chestnut Hill. Is it any use, sir?” added Tom anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any use, man! If General Washington doesn’t make you a Colonel for this
      there is no use in man or boy trying to serve an ungrateful country.”
    </p>
    <p>Then the twins, feeling neglected, said, “We helped, too.”</p>
    <p>“I licked the horses,” cried Bill</p>
    <p>“Aren’t you cold, boys?”</p>
    <p>“Yes, sir, but we never told Tom.”</p>
    <p>
      “By George, but you are a plucky lad. Take this two-headed animal,
      Sergeant. Mount one of them, coat and all, in front of you, and be quick,
      or we shall have them frozen.”
    </p>
    <p>“The other may have my coat,” said Tom.</p>
    <p>“Good,” said the Captain. “You shall wear my own cloak, my lad.”</p>
    <p>
      Seeing Harry’s look of fright and the ready tears, he said: “It’s all
      right, youngsters. Don’t you be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170"
        >[170]</span
      >
      afraid. We are all your friends and I know your father well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to Tom, he said: “This way, my lad. Now, then, give him a knee,
      Sergeant; so, a foot in my stirrup and up you go behind me. Now, then,
      right about by twos, march.”
    </p>
    <p>He went off at a sharp trot with Tom’s arms around his waist.</p>
    <p>“Hold on to the belt,” he said.</p>
    <p>
      “May I some day have a boy like you! I enlist you in my troop. You are one
      of Allan McLane’s rangers. Hold hard. The road is better. I am going to
      gallop.”
    </p>
    <p>
      If ever there was a proud boy it was Tom Markham, for who did not know
      Allan McLane, the terror of outlying pickets, the hero of a dozen gallant
      adventures?
    </p>
    <p>“How are you, Gemini?” cried Tom, looking back.</p>
    <p>“Oh, we’re fine!” roared Bill, his teeth chattering with cold.</p>
    <p>
      At the river they were stopped a minute. McLane gave the password,
      “Washington,” and at dusk they tramped over the bridge and were at once
      among General Varney’s brigades.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill had ceased to ask questions. Harry, again uneasy at the sight of
      soldiers, wept unseen, and even Tom felt a certain awe at thus facing the
      unknown. He was more at ease as he saw hundreds of ill-clad men making
      merry in a wild snowball fight, shouting and laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They rode in the gloom through dimly seen rows of log huts, and at one of
      them McLane dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>“Take your men in,” he
      said to a lieutenant. “Report at headquarters and say I shall be there in
      an hour.” He lifted the twins from their perches and bade the three enter
      his hut. “This is my home, boys. Come in.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a tiny log cabin with a stone-built chimney and a big fire; wood
      alone was to be had—in plenty. The twins felt better after he gave them in
      turn a teaspoonful or two of whiskey in water, laughed at their wry faces
      as they drank, set Harry on his knee, patted him on the back, and bade
      them make free of his stale biscuit and the potatoes he roasted in the hot
      ashes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The twins, as they got warm in this pleasant company, talked of their
      adventures. Tom sat in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What’s the matter?” asked McLane, getting only “Yes” and “no” to his
      queries.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am thinking, sir, of my mother. Oh, but she will be troubled. I never
      thought of that when——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Be easy, my lad. To-morrow I am going into the city. I shall see her.
      When you can get back, I do not know, but you will see the camp and the
      troops and get your share of a trooper’s fare. When you are warm I want
      you to come with me, Tom.”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, sir. I am ready now.”</p>
    <p>
      With a word to the twins he followed the Captain through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men were huddled around campfires and were cooking their scanty
      rations of pork and potatoes. Presently McLane paused at the door of a
      small stone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> house, the
      only one in the lines. A sentry walked to and fro before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane went in and said to an officer: “Mr. Tilghman, ask the General to
      see me. It is important.”
    </p>
    <p>In a few minutes the officer returned. “This way,” he said.</p>
    <p>
      Tom saw seated before the fire a large man in buff-and-blue uniform. He
      rose, saying, “What news have you, Captain?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “This lad, sir, brought from the town at some peril this map and sketch.
      It seems to be some one’s notion of an attack.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The tall officer put the sketch aside, but as he considered the map he
      said, looking up: “This is Major Montresor’s own map and is invaluable.
      What is your name, my boy?”
    </p>
    <p>“I’m a son of Colonel Markham, sir.”</p>
    <p>
      “A most gallant officer. And how, my lad, did you happen to get this map?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom was a little disturbed by this authoritative gentleman. Being a boy,
      he had, of course, been left standing, while McLane and the tall man were
      seated. He understood that he must stand until requested to sit, but it
      did add a little to a certain embarrassment, rare for Tom.
    </p>
    <p>“Tell your story, Tom,” said McLane.</p>
    <p>
      “Well, sir, the horses ran away, and the map was in the sleigh.” Tom
      stopped. Action, not speech, was his gift, then and later.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>“It is not very clear, but
      the lad is tired.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” said Tom, without the least boy desire to describe what was a
      bold and dangerous adventure.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never mind your story now. Captain McLane will tell me later. You are a
      brave lad, and if God had given me one like you I should have been glad.”
    </p>
    <p>Tom felt somehow that he was well rewarded.</p>
    <p>
      “But,” added the tall man, setting kind, blue eyes on the lad, “this will
      make a great stir, and you will, I fear, suffer for it when you reach
      home.”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, sir,” said Tom. “And the twins?”</p>
    <p>“Twins? What’s this, McLane?”</p>
    <p>“There were three in the business,” said the Captain.</p>
    <p>“Indeed. I wish there were as much spirit in the army.”</p>
    <p>
      “After all, sir,” said McLane, “what can they do to a mere boy whose
      horses ran away?”
    </p>
    <p>“But how are they to get to the city?”</p>
    <p>“I will see to that, sir, and let Mrs. Markham know.”</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes, quite right. Now I must be excused.” He rose and shook hands
      with Tom, and bowed to the officer.
    </p>
    <p>“Come, Tom,” said McLane.</p>
    <p>
      Tom made his best bow and they went out into the cold December night. Then
      Tom asked: “Who was that general?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good gracious, my boy, I thought you knew. That<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_174"
        >[174]</span
      >
      was General Washington. He might have thanked you more. But that’s his
      way.”
    </p>
    <p>“I think he said enough, sir.”</p>
    <p>
      McLane looked at the young face, now elate and smiling and then quiet in
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant was waiting in the hut when Tom and the Captain returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane said: “I shall be away for a day or more. Their mother must hear
      news of these lads. I leave them in your care, Lieutenant.”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
    <p>The Captain said good-bye and was gone for two days.</p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the story was told by the troopers and soon repeated at the
      campfires, where the men amused themselves mightily with the twins and
      their narratives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom held his tongue, and wandering saw the earthworks, and the ragged
      soldiers making shoes out of old blankets and plaited straw, or cooking
      frozen potatoes and decayed pickled herring, and growling over their diet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the army wagons come in with wood, the worn-out traces replaced by
      grapevines. He saw men on guard relieved every hour for fear of frozen
      feet, which were shoeless, and more than once a sentry standing on his hat
      for relief, with feet double wrapped in bits of blanket. He ate of horse
      beef at their fires or rode proudly at the head of McLane troops down the
      hill and into the lines of General Greene’s brigades.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>The twins, too, kept him
      busy. They climbed with him the slope of Mount Misery and saw the bridge
      over the Schuylkill, and on the posts which supported it burned in the
      names of favorite generals—Washington, Putnam, Greene, and Lafayette. Once
      Harry, in delicious fear, was allowed to touch off the evening gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dusk on December twenty-eighth the lads found McLane again in his hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hurrah, boys,” he cried, “I have a bag of flour, four sausages, and an
      aged hen. Let’s make slapjacks. After we have fed I have a story.”
    </p>
    <p>
      They had been better fed than their soldier hosts, for, if it was not much
      at a time, there was something to be had at every hut or campfire, and by
      this accumulation of forage they kept themselves fairly supplied. But
      sausage and slapjacks and fried chicken! The boys had their fill for the
      first time since they left home. Then they lay on the floor before the
      fire. The twins looked expectant.
    </p>
    <p>“You promised us a story,” said Bill, “when you came back.”</p>
    <p>“I shall be as good as my word.”</p>
    <p>
      “I don’t want it to begin with ‘Once on a time,’” said Harry, now quite at
      home. “They always begin that way. The Count told us a story on Christmas
      Eve about an angel and it turned out that it wasn’t a real one after all.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That was terrible,” said the Captain. “My story<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_176"
        >[176]</span
      >
      is true. Now and then I go into Philadelphia to see the troops and where
      they are.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But isn’t that dangerous?” asked Tom, who knew well what was the fate of
      a spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, rather. I should be hanged if I were caught, but you see they don’t
      catch me. Two days ago I rode with a trooper to a deserted barn, and there
      I put on a Quaker bonnet, and old woman’s clothes and shoes and horn
      spectacles and with a crutch and a basket of eggs I got of a farmer, I
      walked down Lancaster Pike and hobbled over the floating bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Any one with provisions can get in and have a pass to get out and I have
      been in town several times and am pretty well known as Mrs. Price. I sold
      my eggs, some of them to Sir William Howe’s cook. Then I went to your
      house.”
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, and you saw mother?” cried Harry.</p>
    <p>“Shut up,” said Bill; “I want to hear.”</p>
    <p>
      “When I came to your house, I went to the back gate and was let in by a
      black cook——”
    </p>
    <p>“That’s Nancy,” said Bill.</p>
    <p>
      “I said I had eggs for sale. Then she took me to the hall and I sat down.
      There I saw that red-nosed Colonel come in. I was knitting a stocking and
      was pretty busy, with my spectacles on. Your mother asked the price of my
      eggs and where I lived. When the Colonel heard I lived near Valley Forge
      and had had a lift on a farmer’s cart to get to town, he asked about the
      troops here. I told him some fine yarns, and<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_177"
        >[177]</span
      >
      with this he went away. I should like to catch him and swap him off for
      your father.”
    </p>
    <p>“Did you see Captain Verney?” asked Tom.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes. I am a bit afraid of him. When he came through the hall I had to
      turn my back because my garter was coming down.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your mother and I bargained for my eggs and at last the maid took them.
      Then I whispered, ‘Could I see thee alone?’ She said ‘Yes’ and took me
      into the parlor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I said: ‘Mrs. Markham, thou hast no need to be troubled. The boys are
      safe at Valley Forge. The horses ran away.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “When I said this she cried, and just sat down and said: ‘I have been so
      distressed, but—I knew—Tom—was to be trusted.’”
    </p>
    <p>“Oh!” exclaimed Tom, “did my mother say that?”</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, she said that. I think the less you fellows say at home of the
      runaway the better for you and your friend, Captain Verney. You see, the
      lost map will make a heap of trouble for him—and for you, too, if you are
      not careful.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Then your mother began to ask questions, but I said I was in a hurry, and
      that on New Year’s Eve she must get a pass for a chaise and man to meet
      you on the west side of the middle ferry about nine at night. I said, too,
      ‘Thy boys may have difficulty about a map. Best to see them alone before
      Brimstone can question them. It was very foolish for them to run away with
      that map.’
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>“When I spoke of the map
      she laughed and said: ‘Was that why the horses ran away? Oh, Tom, Tom!’
    </p>
    <p>“Then I said: ‘They can’t do anything to your boys.’</p>
    <p>
      “‘No, but Mr. Verney and the Colonel were much blamed and are very cross.
      However, that night I can see the boys alone. The officers—I mean the
      Colonel and Captain Verney—are to take supper with Mr. Penn at his house
      over the river.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “I asked if it was the place in the woods above the Schuylkill, the place
      he calls The Solitude. I wanted to be sure. Your mother said: ‘Yes. It is
      there, I believe.’ It set me to thinking.
    </p>
    <p>“Of a sudden she turned on me and said: ‘You are no Quaker.’</p>
    <p>
      “I laughed and said: ‘No, madam, I am Captain Allan McLane, at your
      service.’
    </p>
    <p>
      “This did scare her for the risk I ran, but I said there was none. She
      sent you her love. That’s all my story. We found the horses, Tom. I shall
      take one and my Lieutenant the other.”
    </p>
    <p>“I don’t like that,” said Tom.</p>
    <p>“Spoils of war, sir; and now get to bed.”</p>
    <p>“And the fur coats?” asked Tom, anxiously honest.</p>
    <p>
      “We shall return the Count’s. I shall keep the Colonel’s. Now to bed,
      boys.”
    </p>
    <p>“Thank you, sir,” said Tom.</p>
    <p>“That was a fine story,” said Bill. “I like real true stories.”</p>
    <p>“And it ends just right,” said Harry.</p>
    <p>“Oh, that is not the end,” laughed McLane.</p>
    <p>
      Then the boys were curious and questioned their friend, but he would tell
      them no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“To bed,” he cried, and
      rolled them up in blankets on the cabin floor.
    </p>
    <h3>IV</h3>
    <p>
      The days went by, and on the afternoon of December thirtieth the boys rode
      out of camp, the twins well wrapped up in front of troopers and Tom
      mounted on a troop-horse. The day was pleasant and warm for the season,
      and McLane pushed on at speed down the west side of the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a long and hard ride and the twins were tired when, nine miles from
      the city, at a friendly farmer’s, pickets were put out and they spent the
      night and were well fed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stayed all of that day at the farm, and at seven on New Year’s Eve
      the Sergeant went back to camp, leaving but six men. Presently, to Tom’s
      amazement, McLane came out of the barn with his Lieutenant, both dressed
      as British officers and the men as King’s soldiers. Then they mounted as
      before and rode slowly toward town. Tom, very curious, asked questions.
      McLane laughed: “Only a little fancy ball, Tom, and don’t talk. I want to
      think. Later I hope to send you a dispatch.” Tom was puzzled, but rode on
      in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>About nine at night they
      were just outside of the English pickets, not far from the Schuylkill.
      Here they rode into a wood and dismounted. Then McLane on foot led the
      boys down the Lancaster Road.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yonder,” he said, “is a guard. As it is very dark you may get by unseen.
      If not, you must say you are boys from town and have lost your way. Not a
      word of me. Be careful. At the middle ferry bridge you will find a chaise
      and your man-servant. Now be silent and careful and good-bye, Colonel
      Markham.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Full of the boy delight in an adventure so real, Tom went on in the
      darkness with the twins. He saw against the sky a guard on a little
      hillock above the road. A thicket of briers lined the wayside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tom halted and whispered: “We have got to creep, Gemini, and play bears.
      No noise, and go slow.”
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the three went down on their hands and knees in the snow, and,
      Tom leading, crept by the sentry on the bank, who was stamping and beating
      his breast to keep warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now,” said Tom, “for a run to get warmed up”; and, unseen, they ran
      through the darkness on the well-trodden snow of the mid-pike.
    </p>
    <p>
      They soon found the chaise and their servant. He had a pass so that they
      easily went by the guard and after a short drive were at home and in their
      mother’s arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the boys left him, McLane, a little anxious, looked after them for a
      time and returned to his men.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181"
        >[181]</span
      >
      They tied their horses in the wood and, leaving a man to care for them,
      one by one crawled through the thin line of pickets, who were much
      occupied in keeping themselves warm.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very dark, and again the snow was falling and a fierce wind
      blowing. At last the men came together at a low whistle from McLane.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were now close to the house where, in the wood above the Schuylkill,
      Mr. Penn was pleased to entertain his friends. It was a quaint little
      house and still stands to-day in the Zoological Gardens. There is a small
      entrance hall, a winding stair, and on the left a descent to a long
      underground passage ending in two large, cool-storage rooms. One large
      chamber on the first floor looks eastward over the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane knew it all well. It was now long after nine and very dark. The
      partisan officer was safe between the pickets he had passed and those
      along the west shore far below the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his men near the door he went around the house. Then, approaching
      a window, he cautiously looked into the room. A dozen candles were on the
      table, and many more in sconces on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the table sat Mr. Galloway, the British superintendent of police, a
      staunch Tory, Mr. Penn, Colonel Grimstone, and Captain Verney. There were
      several empty chairs. Supper was over. There were empty bottles on the
      table and a big bowl of punch.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel had removed his stiff regulation stock.<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_182"
        >[182]</span
      >
      Galloway had unbuttoned his embroidered waistcoat. Verney was looking at
      his watch.
    </p>
    <p>“A nice party,” said McLane. “Will it incline to be hospitable?”</p>
    <p>Then he returned to the front.</p>
    <p>
      The Lieutenant said: “Their horses are in the stable, the grooms asleep
      beside a fireplace.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A man was put at each window, two left at the door, and, it being now near
      to ten, McLane quietly entered the hall, and then, with his Lieutenant,
      appeared in the supper-room. Mr. Penn arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-evening, sir,” said McLane. “Lieutenant Hand and I have had a long
      ride, and seeing your lights took the liberty——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, most welcome—as are all gentleman of His Majesty’s service. Sit down,
      sir. Colonel Grimstone, you may know these officers.”
    </p>
    <p>“Never saw them in all my life,” said the Colonel gruffly.</p>
    <p>Captain Verney rose and bowed.</p>
    <p>“I beg pardon,” he said, “I did not catch your name.”</p>
    <p>“Captain Head, at your service.”</p>
    <p>“That’s queer,” said Grimstone; “Head and Hand.”</p>
    <p>
      “Sit down,” said the host. “Oh, by George, the servants have gone
      and—Verney, you are the youngest and you know the way, would you fetch
      some wine for us from the cellar?”
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane said a word to his Lieutenant, who rose,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_183"
        >[183]</span
      >
      apologizing. “I want to see to the horses. Be back in a moment.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall he saw Verney take a lantern and go down to the cellar. The
      Lieutenant waited a moment, shot bolt and lock behind the Captain, and,
      returning, sat down by Galloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pray throw off your cloaks, gentlemen,” said Penn. “Will you drink,
      Captain Head?”
    </p>
    <p>
      McLane cast his cloak back from his left shoulder and set a hand on his
      pistols.
    </p>
    <p>“I never drink while on duty, Mr. Penn. You must hold me excused.”</p>
    <p>“As you please, sir,” answered Penn.</p>
    <p>“What’s your regiment?” inquired Grimstone in a thick voice.</p>
    <p>
      “McLane’s Horse! And if a man moves there will be two dead.” For a pistol
      was at the forehead of both the Colonel and Galloway.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were startled, but had wit enough to understand a very unpleasant
      situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t do that!” cried Grimstone. Galloway sat as still and as pale as a
      statue.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I am sorry, Mr. Penn, to disturb you,” said McLane; “but as I have
      neither eaten of your salt nor drunk at your board, you will pardon me.
      Neither do I want you or Mr. Galloway,” he continued, “if you will say, on
      your honor, that you will not leave this room nor give the alarm for half
      an hour.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>Penn said: “Needs must.
      You know the proverb, Captain McLane.”
    </p>
    <p>Galloway said: “Oh, I swear.”</p>
    <p>
      “Kindly put your watch on the table, Mr. Penn. Ten, I see. Captain Verney
      is locked in the cellar. My regards to him. Come, Colonel, and on the
      honor of a gentleman if you speak or resist I shall kill you. Good-night,
      Mr. Penn.”
    </p>
    <p>The Colonel rose with his captor and went out.</p>
    <p>
      “Sergeant, put this gentleman between two men and call in the rest. If he
      ventures to give the alarm shoot him.”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
    <p>
      “Good Heavens!” said Penn to Galloway. “A nice ending for a supper. That
      fellow missed Sir William Howe by only ten minutes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hark! What was that?” said Galloway. Distant shots rang sharp through the
      cold night air.
    </p>
    <p>“They have had trouble with the pickets.”</p>
    <p>“Hope they caught them,” said Galloway.</p>
    <p>
      Penn returned: “He is one of the kind that catches and is never caught.”
      Then, as the noise of a great thumping and pounding fell on his ears, he
      added: “Just listen to Verney!” And he fell back in his chair, convulsed
      with laughter. “No, don’t move, Galloway. It wants fourteen minutes of the
      half-hour. Sir William was in luck.”
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later the amazed and disgusted Verney heard the story. “He did
      not want me, I suppose.” He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185"
        >[185]</span
      >
      knew later that, because of being a gentleman and courteously kind to
      Tom’s mother, McLane was pleased to forget him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Colonel failed to appear at home that night. Verney was late in
      returning, and only at breakfast did Mrs. Markham and the boys, to their
      relief, and greatly to Tom’s delight, learn of the capture of their
      unmannerly guest.
    </p>
    <p>Then the Captain, still a little cross, turned on Tom.</p>
    <p>
      “Now, sir,” he asked, “did you run away with the sleigh or the sleigh with
      you?”
    </p>
    <p>The Count, much amused, listened.</p>
    <p>
      Tom was cornered. Very red in the face, he replied: “The horses ran away
      with both, sir.”
    </p>
    <p>“I may assure Sir William that the horses ran away?”</p>
    <p>
      Tom felt that he was well within the boundary of truth as he said, “Yes.
      They ran like everything. We upset, and Captain McLane found us and took
      us to Valley Forge.”
    </p>
    <p>“And what, sir, became of the map we left in the sleigh?”</p>
    <p>Tom wriggled.</p>
    <p>“I want an answer.”</p>
    <p>“General Washington has it.”</p>
    <p>“Did you give it to him?”</p>
    <p>“No, sir. Captain McLane gave it to him.”</p>
    <p>“I think,” remarked the Count, “that you had better stop here.”</p>
    <p>That was also Tom’s opinion.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“The map was in the
      coat-pocket, I remember.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir. I was to tell Count Einstein, with Captain McLane’s
      compliments, that his coat is at Farmer Nixon’s, near the Cross Keys
      Tavern. He said you could easily get it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The Count expressed his pleasure, and Verney asked no further questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later, just before supper, Tom burst into the room with the
      twins after him.
    </p>
    <p>“He’s got a letter!” cried Bill.</p>
    <p>“He won’t let us see it!” cried Harry.</p>
    <p>They fell on Tom and rolled in wild laughter on the floor.</p>
    <p>“This is too much,” said Mrs. Markham.</p>
    <p>
      Verney rose, and with two or three mild kicks separated the fighting,
      laughing tangle of legs and arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he caught the elder boy by the collar and said: “Stand up on your
      hind legs, Tom, and tell me what this row is about.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “He’s got a letter,” said Bill, “a Quaker man, a farmer, left it; and he
      won’t let us see it till mother reads it.”
    </p>
    <p>“Where is it?” said Verney.</p>
    <p>
      “Here, sir. You’re choking me. You may read it. There’s a message for
      you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Verney looked at the address and read, laughing, “This with
      haste.”
    </p>
    <p>“With your permission, madam,” he said; then he read aloud:</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Valley Forge, January 7,
      1778.

      “To Colonel Thomas Markham, Jr., late of Captain Allan McLane’s Company,

    </p>
    <p>“That’s me!” said Tom.</p>
    <p>“Indeed!” He turned to the contents.</p>
    <div class="blockquot">

        leaving you on the road with Gemini I had the pleasure of Capturing
        Colonel Gravestone, now here on parole and a low diet. He says his name

        and grave. We shall swap him off for Colonel Markham.

      <p>
        My compliments to Captain the Honorable John Verney. Having been a kind
        and courteous guest I forgot him. It was against the rules of the

      <p>About the Boston Tea-party and the Indians who brewed the tea.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      CHANCE has led us to the spot on which the house of Governor Winthrop
      stands. But by the side of it, in a crowded neighborhood, is a brick
      church with a fine and lofty steeple pricking the frosty air of a December
      afternoon. There is a dense crowd of men, with a sprinkling of women,
      arguing and gesticulating about the door, but the interior is so choked up
      with people that we can scarcely elbow our way in. The men’s faces, we
      notice, are flushed and excited, and here is an angry buzz of
      half-suppressed voices. Evidently something out of the common has brought
      these people here. What can it be?
    </p>
    <p>Ah! they are all talking about tea.</p>
    <p>
      “You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink,” one says,
      very significantly, to his neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye, and they can send us tea but can’t make us drink,” responds his
      neighbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let them take it back to England, then, and peddle it out there,”
      ejaculates a third. “We will not have it forced down our throats,” he
      adds.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>“What sort of a drink
      would tea and salt water make?” suggests a man who is evidently losing
      patience; for it has grown dark, and the lamps shed a dim light throughout
      the unquiet crowd.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good for John Rowe!” shout the bystanders approvingly, and as his words
      pass from mouth to mouth, the people laugh and clap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a man of middle age speaks. At his first words every voice is
      hushed. Every eye is turned upon him. In a grave and steady voice he tells
      the people that their purpose to send the tea-ships home to England, with
      their cargoes untouched, has been thwarted by Governor Hutchinson, who
      refuses to give the vessels the pass, without which they cannot sail. “And
      now,” concludes this same grave and earnest voice, to which all eagerly
      listen, “<i>this meeting</i> can do nothing more to save the country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a moment’s silence—a moment of keen disappointment, an ominous
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then some one in the gallery cries out, in a ringing voice, “Boston Harbor
      a tea-pot to-night! Hurrah for Griffin’s Wharf!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly, before the people are aware what is intended, an Indian
      war-whoop pierces the air; and, starting at the signal, no one seems to
      know whence or how, half a hundred men, having their faces smeared with
      soot, and disguised as Indian warriors, brandishing hatchets and shouting
      as they run, pour through Milk Street, followed by the crowd, turn down to
      Griffin’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span> Wharf, where the
      tea-ships lie, clamber on board, take off the hatches in a hurry, and
      while some pass up the chests from the hold others smash and pitch them
      overboard. Crash go the hatchets, splash goes the tea. Splash! splash!
      Every one works for dear life, earnest and determined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never were ships more quickly unloaded. The frightened captains and crews
      were told to go below and stay there if they would not be harmed. They
      obeyed. No one but the fishes drank that tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      After finishing their work the lads who had been making a tea-pot of
      Boston Harbor marched gaily back to town to the music of a fife. While on
      their way they passed by the residence of Mad Montagu, the British admiral
      who commanded all the fleet of war-ships then lying at anchor within
      gunshot of the town. The admiral threw up his window, thrust out his head,
      and halloed:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, boys, you have had a fine, pleasant evening for your Indian caper,
      haven’t you? But mind, you’ve got to pay the fiddler yet!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, never mind, Squire!” shouted Pitts, the leader. “Just come out here,
      if you please, and we’ll settle the bill in two minutes.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The admiral shut his window in a hurry, and the tea-party, with a laugh
      for the admiral, marched on. He was fond of a fight, but thought it best
      to decline this invitation.

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        In this story an old-fashioned “courting-stick” in the hands of a
        quick-witted girl is the means of saving patriot lives and ammunition.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      THE time was the year of Lexington and Concord, and the place, a little
      village not many miles away. Already men’s faces were stern and women’s
      eyes dim with sorrow; only the little children played on and knew no
      difference.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly Pearson scorned the name of child, yet the thought of war brought to
      her only a sense of exhilaration. She had no father or brother to lose;
      but neither had Elizabeth who had not smiled these three months. Why? John
      Thurlow had said no word of enlisting. A shame it was, too—thought
      Dolly—and he a strong man with naught to bind him!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Betty,” said Dolly, who was helping her sister to tidy the best room,
      “why does not John enlist? There, ’tis said now—I just had to! I’ve been
      waiting and waiting because I feared to hurt you by the question!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth turned her quiet face to the saucy one, and smiled a little
      sadly down at the girl. “John will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193"
        >[193]</span
      >
      go soon,” she said. “He is but tarrying till the time be ripe.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well, right glad am I to know it!” cried Dolly. “I always liked John
      Thurlow, but had he been a coward——” She stopped, amazed at Elizabeth’s
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Never name coward and John Thurlow in the same breath again!” she said,
      vehemently, with wrathful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly ran over to her sister repentantly. “Betty, I meant nothing. I could
      not understand his tarrying, that was all. It is because he is going that
      you have looked so sober lately.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes,” said Elizabeth, burying her face in her blue apron. Dolly stared.
      She never cried herself, and never had she seen her sister cry, save when
      their father died. Something of the solemn feeling she had then had now
      silenced her, and she stood smoothing Elizabeth’s hand until the girl
      looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      “There, Dolly, get to work,” she said, “and be glad you are not old enough
      to understand.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Dolly went pouting to her work—at fourteen she didn’t like being thought
      young! Presently something diverted her thoughts. It was a hollow rod,
      eight feet long and an inch in diameter, with a queer mouth and ear-piece
      at each end—an old-time courting-stick that had belonged to her
      grandmother. Dolly held it across to Elizabeth, her face dimpling with
      mischief.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Try it, Betty!” she pleaded. “I want to see if it sounds as well as
      ever.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth held it to her ear, while Dolly’s saucy lips<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_194"
        >[194]</span
      >
      touched the other end. “Betty,” she whispered, “are you not glad that you
      and John don’t have to use this stick?” Elizabeth dropped it impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You heard,” Dolly said innocently. “That was what I desired to know. But
      you might have said something to me!”
    </p>
    <p>
      When Elizabeth’s color came and went, as now, there was no girl like her
      in the village. Indeed, at all times she was prettiest, thought loyal
      Dolly, studying her next day, as they all walked to meeting—Elizabeth in a
      sprigged muslin and a bonnet with rose-colored ribbons. How beautiful she
      looked as she went to the singers’ seats! John Thurlow sat there, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      By turning a little in the pew, Dolly could see the singers’ seats, and
      half the congregation as well. So of course she saw Eunice Winter come in,
      and with her a strange young man, who soon perceived the pretty face under
      the rose-colored ribbons, and glanced at it frequently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes Dolly changed her position and studied the queer old pulpit,
      with its winding stairs and the roofing overhead. There was a loft in the
      roof, and squirrels and birds came in there. Suddenly Dolly gave a start,
      and a look of delight shone in her eyes. After that she heard not even the
      Parson’s “Finally,” and only came to herself when the people rose to
      depart. Then she pulled her sister’s dress.
    </p>
    <p>“Betty, do hasten!” she pleaded. “I have something to tell you.”</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>Elizabeth glanced down at
      the excited face.
    </p>
    <p>“What is it, Dolly?” she asked, anxiety sharpening her quiet voice.</p>
    <p>“Come,” urged Dolly, “away from the others! I <i>must</i> tell you!”</p>
    <p>
      Elizabeth followed her sister to a corner of the meeting-house yard, where
      they were alone.
    </p>
    <p>“What is it, Dolly?” Betty asked again, shaken out of her usual calm.</p>
    <p>
      Dolly leaned forward. “Tell John Thurlow I know where his muskets are,”
      she said, “and if they be not careful, others will know it, too!”
    </p>
    <p>Elizabeth caught the girl’s hand tightly.</p>
    <p>
      “How knew you that, Dolly?” she asked, a great fear choking her. Dolly
      could be trusted, but many Royalists in the neighborhood were seeking just
      this knowledge!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Dolly, delighted at the importance of her discovery, “I saw
      something gleaming through a crack in the roofing. I thought at first
      ’twas the sunlight, but presently I noted some dust in the pew. I put my
      hand down and picked some up and tasted it, and although I be ‘so young,’
      I know powder. Why didn’t you tell me? I’d have died sooner than betray
      it!” Her eyes were flashing through tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it, little sister,” said Elizabeth. “I would trust you as soon as
      myself. But do you not see it would be foolish to take more than were
      necessary into the secret?”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>“Ye-es,” admitted Dolly
      reluctantly, and then with the old mischievous smile, she added: “Betty,
      was it necessary for you to know it?”
    </p>
    <p>“You have a sadly undisciplined tongue, Dolly,” said Betty, coloring.</p>
    <p>
      “But you do not fear to trust me,” said Dolly as they walked slowly back
      across the yard. Then the undisciplined tongue reasserted itself.
    </p>
    <p>“Did you note the fine gallant Eunice Winter had to-day?” she asked.</p>
    <p>“I saw there was a stranger.”</p>
    <p>
      “He scarce took his eyes from a bonnet with rose-colored ribbons. And he
      is much finer-seeming than John Thurlow, Betty!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, Dolly, you’re going too far,” said Elizabeth sternly. “What would
      mother say? It is downright wicked to have such thoughts in the house of
      God.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t get cross,” pleaded Dolly coaxingly. “I paid heed to the parson,
      and I can tell you the text. And for the other matter, time will show if I
      be wrong,” and with a saucy nod she broke away and joined her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time did show. Whatever might be the fault of Mistress Dolly’s tongue, her
      eyes were seldom mistaken. Before a week was over the strange gentleman
      had met Elizabeth and he soon fell into the habit of calling almost daily.
      His name was Henry Robbins, and he was Eunice Winter’s cousin, visiting
      there for a month, he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>All Dolly’s admiration for
      him vanished on the day she suspected he was a Royalist. He had never
      avowed it, but the girl detected a look in his eyes when she spoke of
      Lexington that brought her to her feet in great excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe you’re a Royalist!” she exclaimed, with flashing eyes. “If not,
      why are you tarrying here when the need is so sore? I think a man who
      tarries unconcerned is a coward!”
    </p>
    <p>“Dolly!” remonstrated Elizabeth.</p>
    <p>
      “I do,” answered Dolly angrily. “And I hate cowards! You can excuse me if
      you will, Betty, but I would say it all over again to the king’s face!”
      and she ran out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>The young man looked a little disturbed.</p>
    <p>
      “I pray you overlook the child’s quick tongue,” Elizabeth said. “She is an
      eager little rebel, and loses control of herself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, I am not troubled by a child’s idle talk,” he said. “I admire her
      spirit. Yet I feel I scarce deserve the lash of her words.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I judge no man who follows his conscience. God will direct the right,”
      said Elizabeth gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he had to be content. Yet as he walked down the road he switched
      impatiently at the daisies beside it, and felt ill-satisfied with the part
      he was playing. To live among these people solely to discover their
      preparations for war revolted him, and he did so only at the positive
      order of his general.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>But as days went on, he
      began to despair. No slightest clue could he get of the whereabouts of the
      stores he knew were being collected. Then one day, as he was about to
      return to Boston, a scrap of paper was slipped into his hand by a boy, who
      immediately scampered away. Captain Robbins was standing with a group of
      men at the tavern waiting for the mail-coach, and he carelessly untwisted
      and read the note:
    </p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>Search the loft of the meeting-house. A servant of his majesty.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      A quick glow came into the young man’s face. John Thurlow was standing
      near and looked at him a little curiously. “Good news, judging from your
      face,” said John.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye, the best,” the Royalist said slowly. And never did John Thurlow
      forget the curious tone and look of the Tory.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no difficult matter to examine the loft, which was found nearly
      full of arms and powder. But Robbins did not choose to seize the
      munitions; he hoped to convict Thurlow, at least, if none of the others.
      He set spies on the church, meaning to capture any of the king’s enemies
      who might attempt to take away arms.
    </p>
    <p>Then another note came to him:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        On Monday next there will be a midnight meeting in the loft. It might
        interest the captain to attend.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      It was Saturday afternoon then. One of the Royalists happened to be
      passing the house; the captain called him, and the two young men swung
      into step down the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> road to
      the meeting-house. Dolly Pearson stood watching the two as they walked
      quickly away; then some suspicion came to her from their gestures. She
      tried to dismiss it as foolish, but tried in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly she started off on a run across the fields. When she reached the
      meeting-house her breath was coming in heavy gasps. The building was open
      for one of its rare sweepings, but no one was in sight just then. The girl
      ran in and up the winding stairs and crouched down behind the pulpit, and
      lay there listening and trying to still the noisy beating of her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seemed ages that she crouched there; perhaps she had been mistaken—they
      might not have been coming here—then she started at the sound of voices.
      She dared not peer out. She held herself rigid and listened—listened for
      the life of John Thurlow whom Elizabeth loved.
    </p>
    <p>“Forty muskets and seven kegs of powder,” said one voice.</p>
    <p>“Aye, and Thurlow and his recruits to take all on Monday night?”</p>
    <p>
      “Hist!” said the captain, looking round uneasily. “Walls have ears. Monday
      at midnight you will have a strong band ready. We will surround the
      meeting-house, and then——”
    </p>
    <p>“Down with the rebels! And the pay, captain?”</p>
    <p>
      “Trust His Majesty for that. You can have my own share, too. Success is
      enough for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That and a fair field to Betty Pearson’s favor,”<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_200"
        >[200]</span
      >
      laughed the other. “You are not the only one that would like to see John
      Thurlow out of the way!”
    </p>
    <p>“Then shall I earn their gratitude,” answered Robbins.</p>
    <p>
      Dolly was trembling, and it did not seem as if she could control herself
      much longer; but soon they went away. Then she had to rest long in one of
      the pews to quiet her nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      “What ails you, Dolly?” her mother exclaimed, when she saw her. “You look
      too ill to stand! You ought to go straight to bed while I brew some herbs
      for you.”
    </p>
    <p>“Oh, mother, I can’t go to bed,” said Dolly. “I must see John!”</p>
    <p>“Would I were John!” said a mocking voice.</p>
    <p>
      Dolly’s heart sank within her. She had not noticed the captain as she
      entered. With an effort she summoned one of her saucy smiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good-even, Mr. Robbins—this is an unexpected pleasure! You have not been
      here for so long—why, not since yesterday!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come and entertain me, since I please you so much,” laughed the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Dolly, “it would not be proper to show it. I prefer to talk to
      Betty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And I prefer you should talk to me,” said the captain, and there was a
      note in his voice that startled Dolly. She imagined that she was
      suspected. The color had come back to her face now, and her eyes were
      blazing. Somehow—how, she had not the least idea—she<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_201"
        >[201]</span
      >
      must warn John to-night. To-morrow would be too late, for the captain was
      on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned back in a corner of the big settle, with a saucy laugh answered
      his teasing, and gradually regained control of herself. Yet all her will
      could not keep the color from flying to her face when she heard John’s
      step. She bent down and played with the kitten at her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Miss Dolly was desiring your presence, Mr. Thurlow,” said the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh,” said Dolly carelessly, “never mind, John. That was an hour ago.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Thurlow smiled good-humoredly at her, knowing her to be whimsical. She sat
      wondering how she could get the message to him. Write it? Even could she
      do so unobserved she would have no opportunity to give it to him; of that
      she was certain. Equally sure was she that she would not be allowed to
      leave the room alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a thought came to her and filled her with glee. “Oh, Mr.
      Robbins!” she cried. “Have you ever seen our courting-stick?”
    </p>
    <p>“Courting-stick? What might that be?”</p>
    <p>“I’ll show you,” she answered, starting up. “’Tis in the best room.”</p>
    <p>“Nay, let me get it for you,” he said, rising.</p>
    <p>
      “How can you, if you know it not when you see it?” she retorted. “But you
      may come, too.” She felt a wicked delight in hearing the captain’s
      muttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span> exclamations as
      he followed her into the dim best room, stumbling over table and chairs on
      the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did you hurt yourself, Mr. Robbins?” she exclaimed, in a tone of
      commiseration. “Trouble yourself no more; I have the rod. Here, John,” she
      added, when they had returned, “take the other end while I show Mr.
      Robbins how our grandfathers courted.”
    </p>
    <p>
      John took the rod and Dolly put her lips to her own end. “John,” she
      whispered, “betray no surprise for your life! Mr. Robbins knows about the
      meeting-house loft, and is to lead a band of men to take you Monday night.
      Pretend you cannot hear this well.”
    </p>
    <p>
      John looked up in apparent perplexity. “The old rod is out of use,” he
      said. “Speak louder, Dolly.”
    </p>
    <p>The captain, with a suspicious look, pressed nearer.</p>
    <p>
      “John,” she called, “are you sorry courting-sticks are out of fashion?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “A chilly custom, truly,” said the captain. “Don’t you think, Miss Dolly,
      it was rather hard on the happy pair?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, no,” said Dolly. “Take the other end, Mr. Robbins, and see the
      convenience of it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain took John’s place, but he could not catch the faint whisper.
    </p>
    <p>“I could not hear the words,” he said.</p>
    <p>“Oh, I’ll try again,” said Dolly obligingly.</p>
    <p>
      This time the captain turned away with an amused laugh. “Cool heart that
      could carry on love-making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
      at such a length,” he said. “It is a rare curiosity, though. Shall I carry
      it back, Miss Dolly?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It needs not to be put away now,” Elizabeth said, and Dolly had to give
      up the pleasure of making the captain stumble again in the dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the clock struck nine John rose, and the captain with him. Dolly
      laughed as away through the darkness strode the two men whose fortunes had
      changed strangely since they trod the same road a couple of hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three hours later a strange party in the meeting-house silently lowered
      the powder casks and muskets and carried them to carts outside. When
      morning broke the munitions were stored again five miles away. The men
      were in their usual places when the Sabbath service began.
    </p>
    <p>
      John gave one quick look at Dolly, and she was satisfied. He did not go
      near her after the service, but one and another of the men came and spoke
      to her. They said no word of why they spoke, but she knew, and her heart
      swelled with pride as she counted the bravest of the place among the
      number. They were true patriots, then! She never would doubt them again,
      never!
    </p>
    <p>
      The next night Captain Robbins met his men near the church. Nothing was
      stirring. The captain began to look black.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the men entered through a window and flung the door open. They
      strode into the empty room.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204"
        >[204]</span
      >
      The noise of their footsteps seemed to echo and re-echo. All was solemnity
      of silence. In spite of themselves, they were awed by the time and the
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      “At least,” said Captain Robbins hoarsely, “we will take the stores.” He
      climbed eagerly to the loft ahead of the others. “Your light, Wilson,” he
      called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man handed it up and Robbins held it high above his head. A few
      startled swallows whirred around him and a mouse ran out of some straw on
      the floor. But that was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two visitors at the Pearsons’ the next day. One was the captain
      who called to say farewell. His holiday was up, he said, and he must go
      back to Boston. Dolly watched him as he rode away. Once he turned and
      waved to her. “Good-bye, my little enemy,” he called.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next one was John Thurlow. He caught Dolly’s hands in his strong grip
      and looked down at her so that she colored and tried to get away.
    </p>
    <p>“Why, Dolly!” said Elizabeth, in surprise.</p>
    <p>
      “Has she not told you?” asked John. “She is the bravest little maid I ever
      saw. I know not, even now, how much her quick wit has saved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” said Dolly, looking up, her mischief as usual conquering her
      confusion. “I am naught but a little rebel firebrand—Mr. Robbins said so.
      And Mr. Robbins knows everything except the use of courting-sticks!”
    </p>
    <p>
      She broke away and ran quickly down the lane. The<span

      >
      air was full of soft summer noises, and the leaves and blossoms were
      stirring and flashing and playing in the sunlight, and the day was
      golden—golden! She drew a long breath of content. She was so happy to be
      alive and to have helped a little.
    </p>
    <p>“For I always shall be a rebel as long as I live,” she declared.</p>

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        The author says of Susan that she “was a sociable soul, if occasionally
        a bit difficult”—and we welcome her to our gathering of patriotic heroes
        and heroines.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      THE lower half-door of the Thurrell house side porch was closed because
      Susan Tong’s ball of yarn, which was always slipping from her vast and
      rotund knees, had a way of hopping down the steps if the door were left
      open. Because the garden-path sloped, the ball, if once started, would
      roll far beyond even the longest reach of the odd implement with twin
      handles at one end, flat nippers at the other, and a middle length of
      extensible iron latticework, which had earned Susan, properly the Widow
      Thurrell, the name by which she was commonly known. But the upper half of
      the broad, green-painted door was set wide to the streaming sunshine of a
      mild October afternoon of 1776.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just within the door showed the chintz back, gay with red-patterned
      palm-leaves, of the huge armchair in which sat Susan Tongs herself, her
      smooth bands of red hair just showing beneath her cap, her small, light
      eyes lifted from her work to the golden autumnal landscape,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_207"
        >[207]</span
      >
      her triple chin descending upon a snowy amplitude of kerchief, and a pair
      of long steel needles clicking in her two fat hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan possessed two distinctions: she was the fattest person in the
      village, and she was the only fat person in it who had not an easy-going
      disposition. Too unwieldy for many years past to move about upon her
      little feet and weak ankles without the assistance of her crutch-handled
      staff, her utmost exertion was to cross the road to the meeting-house on
      Sundays; week-days she spent in her chair, directing the household tasks
      of her pretty niece, Tamsine, who did not have a very easy life of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Susan Thurrell, everybody said, had been notably brisk and light of foot
      in her youth, and the burden of flesh which had come upon her in later
      life was particularly unwelcome, and far from being accompanied by a
      corresponding increase in mental grace. She was certainly very exacting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just what her weight was no one knew; her own guess was “nigh about two
      hundred and fifty,” but there were many who vowed it was three hundred if
      it was a pound.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mottled hen which had somehow got into the garden patch caught Susan’s
      eye, and a shadow of anger overcast her wide face. The creature was
      clucking its way, followed by a lone chicken, directly toward her favorite
      bed of sweet herbs. She shouted a husky “Shoo,” but without effect; then
      she caught up her “lazy man’s tongs,” which lay near.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>Quickly compressing the
      handles, she shot the tip out to its farthest extent and picked up with it
      a crust of bread fallen from the dinner-table and overlooked, for Tamsey,
      the orderly caretaker, had been called away in haste that day to a sick
      neighbor. This crust she flung at the invader. The hen squawked and ran,
      but presently returned to peck cheerfully at the missile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still wheezing from the exertion of a rapid movement, Susan uttered a
      grunt of disgust, and with lazy-tongs still in hand glanced about for
      something else to throw. As she turned to look behind her chair she saw,
      at the far end of the room, leaning against the mantelpiece to which he
      seemed to cling for support, a young man, scarcely more than a boy, very
      pale and breathing heavily, and with a queerly mingled look of courage and
      terror in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>“Othniel Purdie!” she cried. “What are you doing in my kitchen?”</p>
    <p>
      He only panted, and she stared at him in amazement fast deepening to
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why ain’t you with General Washington?” she demanded. “What are you back
      here in Norley for? Folks said you’d run away to join the army. Don’t you
      know there’s a British camp at the other end of the town, and British
      officers quartered at Parson Hackett’s and Marchant Cole’s? What are you
      here for?—and looking scared as a hunted rabbit! I never liked you, and I
      won’t have you hanging around my niece, Tamsey; but I do hope to
      Providence you’ve not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
      deserted. I couldn’t bear to think any Norley boy would do that. Speak up,
      can’t you? What are you here for?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I haven’t deserted,” the young fellow managed to say, “and I know well
      enough the place is full of redcoats. They want me, and I’m afraid they’ll
      get me, and it’s all up if they do.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Want you? What for?” She looked at him again, and between her heavy
      cheeks and the overhanging roll of her eyebrows a gleam of fiery
      intelligence came into her two little gray-blue eyes, small and hard and
      wise, like an elephant’s.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Where’s your uniform? What are you holding to the front of your shirt
      for? Have you papers there? Despatches? Are you trying to steal through
      the lines? That’s the same as spying, isn’t it? Good mercy, you’ll be
      hanged; of course you will!”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not needed to answer any of her quick questions in words; she took
      the answer from his eyes without waiting, and scolded on: “And I suppose
      you stopped here for a sight of Tamsey, but she’s away and you won’t see
      her, and glad I am of that. The zanies boys are! You’d better slip away
      quick and hide till dark; there’s a place in the shed loft where nobody——”
    </p>
    <p>
      He interrupted her. “I can’t get there. I can’t go any farther. I’ve
      sprained my ankle and I fainted twice getting here the back way from
      Royd’s wood-lot, where I dodged them and they lost me. But they haven’t
      given it up, and I heard them say they’d search<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_210"
        >[210]</span
      >
      every house in the village. But this was the only place I could get away
      to, and so I came. I can’t go any farther; I’ll faint again if I try. I
      thought maybe Tamsey’d hide me. I know you don’t like me, Mrs. Thurrell,
      but I thought you’d let her, when it was life and death—and there are the
      papers——”
    </p>
    <p>“Give them to me,” said Susan.</p>
    <p>
      “Here—I know you’ll take good care of them, at any rate, and you’ll send
      them on by a safe hand if I’m taken, won’t you, Mrs. Thurrell?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Mmm!” grunted Susan. “Twist them up and toss them in the woodbox there
      with the kindlings—it’s in plain sight and won’t be thought of. Now we’ve
      got to hurry—hurry—hurry, if we’re going to save that neck of yours; and,
      land, what a poor pair we are for hurrying!”
    </p>
    <p>
      Laughing fiercely, and gripping the arms of her seat, Susan had risen
      painfully as she talked, and now, supporting herself on her staff, stood
      up and shoved the great chair a little to one side. A trap-door showed in
      the floor where it had stood, and she explained quickly that the kitchen
      had been a later addition to the house; that the main cellar did not
      extend beneath it, but that there was below a small, square pit for
      storage, large enough to conceal a man at need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, crying to Othniel to catch, she tossed him her crutch-stick, and
      leaning heavily upon it, he crossed the room to her side. Directing him to
      lean on the chair, she resumed her staff, and, reversing it, hooked open
      the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span> trap-door with the
      crutch end, and signed to him to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated. “They’ll find it,” he said; “it’s in plain sight as soon as
      your chair is moved. If I must be caught, I’d rather be caught above
      ground than hauled out of a hole, like a woodchuck.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You go down,” said Susan grimly, “I’m going to put that chair back and
      sit in it; and move it they don’t neither, not if they’re the whole
      British army!”
    </p>
    <p>
      He lowered himself to the edge and slipped down, wincing and biting his
      lips as he curled up in the little square space, adjusting his injured
      ankle in his hand. For a moment his clear eyes looked up to Susan’s with
      gratitude and appeal; then the lid closed. He heard shoving and shuffling
      and the settling of a heavy weight in place overhead, and after that the
      swift and steady click of knitting-needles.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young English officer, accompanied by a sergeant and four soldiers,
      coming briskly up the garden-path not ten minutes later, found Susan Tongs
      knitting as usual, just within her doorway. She scarcely glanced up while
      the officer, a youngster hardly older than Othniel, briefly stated his
      errand and demanded admittance; but when he had concluded, she shot him an
      indignant look.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Search my house!” she cried. “Do you suppose I want your soldiers’ dirty
      fingers poking in my linen-chest and overhauling my gowns and petticoats,
      all to find a good-for-nothing lad that’s been forbid the place<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_212"
        >[212]</span
      >
      this two years? Ask any of the neighbors what were the last words I had
      with Othniel Purdie, and whether he’s likely to be hiding here or not—ask
      ’em! I don’t believe you even think he’s here. I believe it’s an excuse to
      steal my property and drink my cider. How should he be here? Last folks
      heard, he was off to General Washington—God bless him——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What! What!” cried the young officer, lifting his eyebrows and laughing.
      Susan set her teeth and clicked her needles hard. “We hear there’s a
      pretty niece of yours, who’s not so hard on the young man,” he went on;
      “and since you’re so frankly a rebel yourself, Mrs. Tongs, you’ll admit
      it’s not a bad guess that she may have coaxed you into protecting even a
      lover you don’t like, when he’s doing spy’s work for your admired General
      Washington. I shall certainly search the house.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “My name is Mrs. Thurrell, young man; it’s only old friends and neighbors
      who may call me ‘Susan Tongs,’” answered Susan dryly. “And no coaxing of
      my silly niece, Tamsey—not if she coaxed from now till judgment—should
      drive me to harboring any lad against my will. I do as I please in my own
      house. But she’s a soft thing, and young, and it’s possible she might have
      slyed him in by the back way, if he’s really in town and hiding; you see I
      sit here all day, and could little tell what went on in the rest of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The notion of Othniel Purdie stowed away in secret in cupboard or closet
      of mine pleases me no more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213"
        >[213]</span
      >
      it does you,” she scolded on; “so on second thoughts you may search and
      welcome, provided only you look well after your men and see there’s no
      mauling of my quilts and calicoes—manners, sir, manners! Would you shove
      by a woman, hat cocked, on her own threshold, when she has bidden you to
      come in? Keep back, or come properly!” for the young lieutenant, impatient
      of further talk, had started to push past Susan, whose great chair and
      person almost blocked the way, and had made a sign to a soldier as if
      commanding him to assist in removing the obstacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before the soldier could mount the steps, and quick as the officer’s
      hand touched her chair, Susan had snatched up her lazy-tongs—there was a
      snap, a glint of shining dark metal, and the nippers clicked together
      within an inch of his ear. He uttered a dismayed oath and leaped backward
      down the low steps, where he would have fallen had not the grinning
      soldier caught him in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>Recovering himself, he cried, furiously, “Put down that pistol!”</p>
    <p>Susan smiled a grandmotherly smile and gently shook her head.</p>
    <p>
      The soldier’s grin broadened. “’Twa’n’t a pistol, sir,” he explained
      respectfully. “I don’t know what it was; but ’twa’n’t a pistol.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let me pass!” said the officer, reassured but mortified, and springing
      again up the steps. “Move aside and let me pass, woman!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>“Woman, and an old woman,”
      answered Susan serenely, “and surely you may pass, for I told you so. But
      a woman of my weight moves slowly, and it behooves a young gentleman to
      show patience. I will be treated civilly under my own roof; and I won’t
      budge an inch for a swaggering boy with his hat on—there!” she continued,
      as he thrust roughly by, squeezed nearly flat between the armchair and the
      door-jamb, “there’s for your impudence!”
    </p>
    <p>
      This time her aim was better, and the tongs snicked sharply together with
      the tip of his queue between them, with the result that, as he pushed on
      and Susan held fast, his head was sharply jerked, and his gilt-laced hat
      fell off at her feet. With a leisurely closing of the nippers, Susan
      picked it up and put it on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You can have it again when you go,” she said soothingly, as if speaking
      to a fretful child. “And will you ask your man there to go round to the
      other door? As you have just found, young sir, this door’s scarcely wide
      enough for two, when I am one of them, and he is stouter than you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, red and angry, the young fellow glared upon her fiercely;
      but she met his look with one so steady, placid, and grandmotherly, yet
      with a glimmer of humor in it, too, that his wrath suddenly vanished in a
      burst of boyish laughter. He signed to the soldier to go round to the back
      door, as the others had already done, and held out his hand for Susan’s
      lazy-tongs, which he played with curiously, snapping and nipping<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_215"
        >[215]</span
      >
      with them at the air, while he directed the elaborate search of the lower
      rooms. Then they all went upstairs together, and heavy feet were heard
      clumping through the bedrooms for a long time. At last the stairs creaked,
      and they descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Did your soldiers handle my linen?” asked Susan eagerly, with a face of
      deep, housewifely anxiety. “I suppose they have tumbled the whole chestful
      out in a heap.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No, indeed—we’ve scarcely shaken out the lavender,” the lieutenant
      answered, smiling pleasantly; adding, with a glance of mock terror at the
      tongs, “May I have my hat?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Let your sergeant go to the pantry first, if you please. I can’t wait on
      you myself, but there are doughnuts and a jug of sweet cider on the shelf,
      at your service,” she replied hospitably, and as it was the last house of
      the village, and they had no further searching to do, they accepted the
      modest treat gratefully, and the four soldiers gathered, munching and
      sipping, around the kitchen fire in most friendly fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      No shadow of suspicion remained, but the mischievous young commander
      lifted his mug, and saying, “This is for the pull you gave my hair, Mrs.
      Thurrell, and no punishment at that if you were a properly loyal subject,”
      he drank to the king’s health.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Pour out a mug for me, too, sergeant,” demanded Susan, with sparkling
      eyes; but as the man tipped the pitcher to obey, his officer stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>“No, no!” he cried,
      laughing and waving it aside. “She will drink to General Washington!”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes, that she would, young sir!” said Susan Tongs.</p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      Next day, with his precious despatches rescued from the woodbox and his
      ankle much better, Othniel escaped in a patriotic neighbor’s load of hay.
      After the war ended he married Tamsey, with no opposition from Susan,
      whose temper softened with time, and who, ever after having saved him,
      lavished upon him an affection as great as her former dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed, it was a joke in the household—for they shared one home—that Aunt
      Susan was never cross now unless Tamsey forgot to give her husband his
      favorite kind of cake for supper, or left a rent in his coat unmended
      longer then five minutes after he took it off! Then there was a tempest.
      But Tamsey was so fond both of Othniel and Susan Tongs that she could let
      it rage about her quite untroubled, duteously veiling her amusement, and
      listening with an air of meek respect until it spent itself, and peace
      returned.

        THE LITTLE MINUTE-MAN<a

    </div>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        We have all heard of the “minute-men,” but do you know about the little
        boy who played minute-man inside of a big grandfather’s clock, while the
        redcoats were waiting to capture his father?
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap2">
      ALL during the winter Brinton had been saying what he would do if the
      redcoats came, and grieving because his age, which was eight, prevented
      him from going with his father to fight under General Washington.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every night, when his mother tucked him in his bed and kissed him
      good-night, he told her not to be afraid, that he had promised his father
      to protect her, and he proposed to do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      His plan of action, in event of the sudden appearance of the enemy, varied
      somewhat from day to day, but in general outline it consisted of a bold
      show of force at the front gate and a flank attack by Towser, the dog.
      Should these tactics fail to discourage the British, he intended to retire
      behind a stone fort he had built on the lawn, between the two tall elms,
      and to fire stones at the invaders until they fell back in confusion,
      while his mother would look on and encourage him from the front porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>When the redcoats
      unexpectedly appeared in the distance, one afternoon in May, what Brinton
      really did was to run helter-skelter down the road, up the broad path to
      the house, through the front hall into the library, close the door, and
      then peep out of the window to watch them go by.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he first caught sight of the soldiers Brinton was sure that there was
      at least a regiment of them, but when they were opposite the front gate
      all that he could see were a corporal and three privates. Instead of
      keeping on their way, however, they turned up the path toward the house,
      and then it seemed to Brinton that they were the most gigantic human
      beings that he had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother was away for the day, and had taken Towser with her. This,
      together with the fact that the enemy were now between him and his fort,
      entirely spoiled Brinton’s plan of campaign, and he decided to seek at
      once some more secluded spot, and there to devise something to meet the
      changed conditions. But when he started to run out of the room, he found
      that in his hurry he had left the front door open, so that any one in the
      hall would be in plain sight of the soldiers, who were now very near.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately there was no other door by which Brinton could leave the
      room. What was worse, there was no closet in which he could hide. The
      soldiers were now so close at hand that he could hear their voices, and a
      glance through the window showed him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219"
        >[219]</span
      >
      that two of them were going around to the back of the house, as if to cut
      off any possible escape in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      And his mother would not be back until six o’clock. Instinctively his eyes
      sought the face of the tall time-piece in the corner. It was just three;
      and he could hear the soldiers’ steps on the front porch!
    </p>
    <p>The clock!</p>
    <p>
      Surely there was room within its generous case for a very small boy. In
      less time than it takes to write it Brinton was inside, and had turned the
      button with which the door was fastened. As he pressed himself close
      against the door, so that there should be room for the pendulum to swing
      behind him, he heard the corporal enter the room. He knew it must be the
      corporal, because he ordered the other man to go upstairs and look around
      there, while he searched the room on the other side of the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brinton could hear the footsteps of the men as they walked about the
      house, and their voices as they talked to each other. Then all was quiet
      for a long while. He was just on the point of peeping out when all four
      men entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Well,” said a voice that he recognized as the corporal’s, “it is plain
      there is no one at ’ome. Me own himpression is that the bird’s flown. ’E’s
      probably started back for camp, and the wife and the kid with ’im. I don’t
      believe in payink no hattention to w’at them Tories says, nohow, goink
      back on their own neighbors—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220"
        >[220]</span
      >
      kin, too, like as not. It’s just to curry favor with the hofficers, it’s
      me own hopinion. ’Ow did ’e know the Major was comink ’ome to-day,
      anyhow?”
    </p>
    <p>Nobody answered him. Perhaps he didn’t expect any one to.</p>
    <p>
      The Major! Brinton’s own father! He was coming home! This, then, was the
      surprise that his mother had said she would bring him when she went off
      with Towser in the morning to go to Colonel Shepard’s. And now those
      redcoats were going to sit there and wait until he came, and then—Brinton
      did not know what would happen, whether he would be shot on the spot, or
      merely put in prison for the rest of his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, if he could only get out and run to meet his father and warn him! But
      the men seemed to give no signs of leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>“Perhaps he hasn’t come at all yet,” suggested one of the privates.</p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps ’e hasn’t,” answered the voice of the corporal; “but w’y, then,
      wouldn’t his folks be ’ere a-waitink for ’im? ’Owever, I’ll give ’im
      hevery chance. It’s now five-and-twenty minutes after three. I’ll give ’im
      huntil six, but if ’e doesn’t turn hup by then, we’ll start away for the
      shore without ’im.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Six o’clock!” thought the boy in the clock. The very time his mother had
      told him she was going to be home again “with something very nice for
      him.” And now she and his brave papa would walk right into<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_221"
        >[221]</span
      >
      the arms of these dreadful English soldiers, and he could not stop them!
    </p>
    <p><i>Whang!</i></p>
    <p>
      What a noise! It startled Brinton so much that he nearly knocked the clock
      over; and then he realized that it was only the clock striking half-past
      three.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-past three! He had been in there only half an hour, and already he
      was so tired he could hardly stand up. How could he ever endure it until
      four, until half-past four, five, six?
    </p>
    <p>
      “If only something, some accident even, will happen to detain papa and
      mamma!” he thought. But how much more likely, it occurred to him, that his
      father, having but a short leave of absence, would hasten, and arrive
      before six.
    </p>
    <p>“Tick-tock,” went the clock.</p>
    <p>
      “How slow, how very slow!” thought Brinton, and he wished there were only
      some way of hurrying up the time, so that the soldiers would go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the soldiers stayed in the room, all but one, who had gone into the
      kitchen to watch from there.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tick-tock,” went the clock, and “whang—whang—whang—whang!” Only four
      o’clock. Brinton began to fear that he could not hold out much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tick-tock,” went the clock. Each swing of the pendulum marked one second,
      Brinton’s mother had told him. If he could only make it swing quicker, so
      that the seconds would fly a little faster!
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why not try to?” Brinton was on the point of<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_222"
        >[222]</span
      >
      breaking down. He was desperate. He felt that he must do something. He
      took hold of the pendulum and gave it a little push. It yielded readily to
      his pressure. None of the soldiers seemed to notice it. He gave it another
      push. The result was the same. Brinton began to pick up courage, and he
      pushed the pendulum to and fro, to and fro, to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to keep it swinging at a perfectly even rate, and apparently he
      succeeded. At any rate, the soldiers appeared to notice nothing different.
      Yet Brinton was sure that he was causing the old clock to tick off its
      seconds at a considerably livelier gait than usual. Half-past four came
      almost before he knew it, but by five o’clock Brinton began to realize
      that he was very, very tired. He had been standing two hours already in
      that cramped, dark, close case, and he had pushed the pendulum first with
      one hand and then with the other in that narrow space until both felt sore
      and lame. Yet now that he had once begun, he did not dare leave off, and
      still it did not seem possible that he could keep it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers had kept very quiet for a long time. Brinton thought that two
      of them must be napping.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five o’clock the soldier who was awake aroused the corporal and the
      other private, whom the corporal sent to relieve the man on guard in the
      kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I must ’ave slept mighty sound,” remarked the corporal. “I’d never
      believe I’d been asleep an hour, if I didn’t see it hon the clock.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No soigns av any wan yit,” reported the man who<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_223"
        >[223]</span
      >
      had been in the kitchen, whom Brinton judged to be an Irishman. “Be’s ye
      going to wait till six?”
    </p>
    <p>“Yes,” answered the corporal. “But no longer.”</p>
    <p>
      Then they began talking about the British fleet that was cruising in Long
      Island Sound, and about the ship on which they were temporarily quartered
      until they could join the main body of the army, and how a neighbor of
      Brinton’s father’s and mother’s had been down at the store when a ship’s
      boat had put in for water, and how he had told the officer in charge that
      Major Hall, Brinton’s father, was expected home for a few hours that day,
      and what a fine opportunity it would be to make an important capture.
    </p>
    <p>The clock struck half-past five.</p>
    <p>
      “H’m!” grunted the corporal. “It doesn’t seem that late; but, you know,
      you can’t tell anythink about anythink in this blarsted country.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Brinton now began to be very much afraid that his father would come before
      the soldiers left. He wanted to move the pendulum faster and faster, but
      after what the corporal had said he did not dare to. Then, when the men
      lapsed into silence, it suddenly came over Brinton how dreadfully weary he
      was, how all his bones ached, and how much, how very much, he wanted to
      cry. But he felt that his father’s only chance of safety lay in his
      keeping the pendulum swinging to and fro, to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, however, came the welcome sound of the corporal’s voice bidding
      the men get ready to start.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span
      >Whang—whang—whang—whang—whang—whang!
    </p>
    <p>“Fall in!” ordered the corporal. “Forward, march!”</p>
    <p>
      As the sound of their footsteps died away, Brinton, all of a tremble,
      opened the door of the clock and stumbled out. He knelt at the window and
      watched the retreating forms of the redcoats. As they disappeared down the
      road he heard a noise behind him, and jumped up with a start.
    </p>
    <p>There stood his father!</p>
    <p>The next instant Brinton was sobbing in his arms.</p>
    <p>
      Brinton’s mother came into the room. “Dear me!” she said; “what ever can
      be the matter with the clock? It’s half an hour fast.”

      <p>
        A very short story, showing a British general’s admiration for American
        boys who were not afraid to stand up for their rights.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      PERHAPS you have heard that even in these old times the Boston boys were
      in the habit of coasting on the Common. They would build hills of snow and
      slide swiftly down to the Frog Pond. Well, the English soldiers had their
      camps on the Common, and from mere love of mischief would, when the boys
      had gone to school, destroy their coasting-ground. Incensed at having
      their sport thus meanly prevented, a delegation of boys went to General
      Gage about it. When shown into his presence he asked, with surprise, why
      so many children had come to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We come, sir,” said the young spokesman, with a flushed face, “to ask a
      redress of our grievances.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What!” said the general, “have your fathers been teaching you rebellion,
      and sent you here to utter it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nobody sent us, sir,” replied the brave little fellow. “We have never
      injured or insulted your soldiers, but they have trodden down our
      snow-hills, and broken the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
      ice on our skating-ground. We complained, and they called us young rebels,
      and told us to help ourselves if we could. Yesterday our works were
      destroyed for the third time, and now,” said the lad, with flashing eyes,
      “we will bear it no longer.”
    </p>
    <p>
      General Gage looked at the boys with undisguised admiration. Then, turning
      to an officer who stood near, he exclaimed:
    </p>
    <p>
      “Good heavens, the very children draw in a love of liberty with the air
      they breathe.” To the lads he then said:
    </p>
    <p>
      “You may go, my brave boys; and be assured that if any of my troops
      hereafter molest you, they shall be severely punished.”

    </div>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        In this Revolutionary story of Cooper’s, the Spy was one of Washington’s
        most faithful helpers. The following pages tell of their last meeting,
        shortly before the close of the war.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      THE commencement of the year was passed, on the part of the Americans, in
      making great preparations, in conjunction with their allies, to bring the
      war to a close. In the south, Greene and Rawdon made a bloody campaign
      that was highly honorable to the troops of the latter, but which, by
      terminating entirely to the advantage of the former, proved him to be the
      better general of the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      New York was the point that was threatened by the allied armies; and
      Washington, by exciting a constant apprehension for the safety of that
      city, prevented such reënforcements from being sent to Cornwallis as would
      have enabled him to improve his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, as autumn approached, every indication was given that the final
      moment had arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French forces drew near to the royal lines, passing through the
      Neutral Ground, and threatened an attack in the direction of Kingsbridge,
      while large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> bodies of
      Americans were acting in concert. By hovering around the British posts,
      and drawing nigh in the Jerseys, they seemed to threaten the royal forces
      from that quarter also. The preparations partook of the nature of both a
      siege and a storm. But Sir Henry Clinton, in the possession of intercepted
      letters from Washington, rested securely within his lines, and cautiously
      disregarded the solicitations of Cornwallis for succor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was at the close of a stormy day in the month of September that a large
      assemblage of officers was collected near the door of a building that was
      situated in the heart of the American troops, who held the Jerseys. The
      age, the dress, and the dignity of deportment of most of these warriors
      indicated them to be of high rank; but to one in particular was paid a
      deference and obedience that announced him to be of the highest. His dress
      was plain, but it bore the usual military distinctions of command. He was
      mounted on a noble animal, of a deep bay, and a group of young men, in
      gayer attire, evidently awaited his pleasure, and did his bidding. Many a
      hat was lifted as its owner addressed this officer; and when he spoke, a
      profound attention, exceeding the respect of mere professional etiquette,
      was exhibited on every countenance. At length the General raised his own
      hat, and bowed gravely to all around him. The salute was returned, and the
      party dispersed, leaving the officer without a single attendant, except
      his body-servants and one aide-de-camp. Dismounting,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_229"
        >[229]</span
      >
      he stepped back a few paces, and for a moment viewed the condition of his
      horse with the eye of one who well understood the animal, and then,
      casting a brief but expressive glance at his aide, he retired into the
      building, followed by that gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      On entering an apartment that was apparently fitted for his reception, he
      took a seat, and continued for a long time in a thoughtful attitude, like
      one in the habit of communing much with himself. During this silence the
      aide-de-camp stood in expectation of his orders. At length the General
      raised his eyes, and spoke in those low, placid tones that seemed natural
      to him:
    </p>
    <p>“Has the man whom I wished to see arrived, sir?”</p>
    <p>“He waits the pleasure of your Excellency.”</p>
    <p>“I will receive him here, and alone, if you please.”</p>
    <p>
      The aide bowed and withdrew. In a few minutes the door again opened, and a
      figure, gliding into the apartment, stood modestly at a distance from the
      General, without speaking. His entrance was unheard by the officer, who
      sat gazing at the fire, still absorbed in his own meditations. Several
      minutes passed, when he spoke to himself in an undertone:
    </p>
    <p>
      “To-morrow we must raise the curtain, and expose our plans. May heaven
      prosper them!”
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight movement made by the stranger caught his ear, and he turned his
      head, and saw that he was not alone. He pointed silently to the fire,
      toward which the figure advanced, although the multitude of his garments,
      which seemed more calculated for disguise than<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_230"
        >[230]</span
      >
      comfort, rendered its warmth unnecessary. A second mild and courteous
      gesture motioned to a vacant chair, but the stranger refused it with a
      modest acknowledgment. Another pause followed, and continued for some
      time. At length the officer arose, and opening a desk that was laid upon
      the table near which he sat, took from it a small but apparently heavy
      bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Harvey Birch,” he said, turning to the stranger, “the time has arrived
      when our connection must cease; henceforth and forever we must be
      strangers.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The peddler dropped the folds of the greatcoat that concealed his
      features, and gazed for a moment earnestly at the face of the speaker;
      then dropping his head upon his bosom, he said meekly:
    </p>
    <p>“If it be your Excellency’s pleasure.”</p>
    <p>
      “It is necessary. Since I have filled the station which I now hold, it has
      become my duty to know many men, who, like yourself, have been my
      instruments in procuring intelligence. You have I trusted more than all; I
      early saw in you a regard to truth and principle, that, I am pleased to
      say, has never deceived me—you alone know my secret agents in the city,
      and on your fidelity depend, not only their fortunes, but their lives.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He paused, as if to reflect, in order that full justice might be done to
      the peddler, and then continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I believe you are one of the very few that I have employed who have acted
      faithfully to our cause; and, while you have passed as a spy of the enemy,
      have never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span> given
      intelligence that you were not permitted to divulge. To me and to me only
      of all the world, you seem to have acted with a strong attachment to the
      liberties of America.”
    </p>
    <p>
      During this address Harvey gradually raised his head from his bosom, until
      it reached the highest point of elevation; a faint tinge gathered in his
      cheeks, and, as the officer concluded, it was diffused over his whole
      countenance in a deep glow, while he stood proudly swelling with his
      emotions, but with eyes that modestly sought the feet of the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is now my duty to pay you for these services; hitherto you have
      postponed receiving your reward, and the debt has become a heavy one—I
      wish not to undervalue your dangers: here are a hundred doubloons; you
      will remember the poverty of our country, and attribute to it the
      smallness of your pay.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The peddler raised his eyes to the countenance of the speaker, but, as the
      other held forth the money, he moved back, as if refusing the bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is not much for your services and risks, I acknowledge,” continued the
      General, “but it is all that I have to offer; at the end of the campaign
      it may be in my power to increase it.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Does your Excellency think that I have exposed my life, and blasted my
      character, for money?”
    </p>
    <p>“If not for money, what then?”</p>
    <p>
      “What has brought your Excellency into the field? For what do you daily
      and hourly expose your precious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232"
        >[232]</span
      >
      life to battle and the halter? What is there about me to mourn, when such
      men as you risk their all for our country? No, no, no, not a dollar of
      your gold will I touch; poor America has need of it all!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The bag dropped from the hand of the officer, and fell at the feet of the
      peddler, where it lay neglected during the remainder of the interview. The
      officer looked steadily at the face of his companion, and continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There are many motives which might govern me that to you are unknown. Our
      situations are different; I am known as the leader of armies—but you must
      descend into the grave with the reputation of a foe to your native land.
      Remember that the veil which conceals your true character cannot be raised
      in years—perhaps never.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Birch again lowered his face, but there was no yielding of the soul in the
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You will soon be old; the prime of your days is already past; what have
      you to subsist on?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “These!” said the peddler, stretching forth his hands that were already
      embrowned with toil.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But those may fail you; take enough to secure a support to your age.
      Remember your risks and cares. I have told you that the characters of men
      who are much esteemed in life depend on your secrecy; what pledge can I
      give them of your fidelity?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Tell them,” said Birch, advancing, and unconsciously resting one foot on
      the bag, “tell them that I would not take the gold!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>The composed features of
      the officer relaxed into a smile of benevolence, and he grasped the hand
      of the peddler firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Now, indeed, I know you; and although the same reasons which have
      hitherto compelled me to expose your valuable life will still exist, and
      prevent my openly asserting your character, in private I can always be
      your friend; fail not to apply to me when in want or suffering, and so
      long as God giveth to me, so long will I freely share with a man who feels
      so nobly and acts so well. If sickness or want should ever assail you, and
      peace once more smile upon our efforts, seek the gate of him whom you have
      so often met as Harper, and he will not blush to acknowledge you in his
      true character.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is little that I need in this life,” said Harvey; “so long as God
      gives me health and honest industry, I can never want in this country; but
      to know that your Excellency is my friend is a blessing that I prize more
      than all the gold of England’s treasury.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer stood for a few moments in the attitude of intense thought. He
      then drew to him the desk, and wrote a few lines on a piece of paper, and
      gave it to the peddler.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That Providence destines this country to some great and glorious fate I
      must believe, while I witness the patriotism that pervades the bosoms of
      her lowest citizens,” he said. “It must be dreadful to a mind like yours
      to descend into the grave, branded as a foe<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_234"
        >[234]</span
      >
      to liberty; but you already know the lives that would be sacrificed,
      should your real character be revealed. It is impossible to do you justice
      now, but I fearlessly intrust you with this certificate, should we never
      meet again, it may be serviceable to your children.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Children!” exclaimed the peddler; “can I give to a family the infamy of
      my name!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer gazed with pain at the strong emotion he exhibited and he made
      a slight movement toward the gold; but it was arrested by the expression
      of his companion’s face. Harvey saw the intention, and shook his head, as
      he continued more mildly:
    </p>
    <p>
      “It is, indeed, a treasure that your Excellency gives me; it is safe, too.
      There are men living who could say that my life was nothing to me,
      compared to your secrets. The paper that I told you was lost I swallowed
      when taken last by the Virginians. It was the only time I ever deceived
      your Excellency, and it shall be the last; yes, this is, indeed, a
      treasure to me; perhaps,” he continued, with a melancholy smile, “it may
      be known after my death who was my friend; but if it should not, there are
      none to grieve for me.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Remember,” said the officer, with strong emotion, “that in me you will
      always have a secret friend; but openly I cannot know you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know it, I know it,” said Birch; “I knew it when I took the service.
      ’Tis probably the last time I shall ever see your Excellency. May God pour
      down His choicest blessings on your head!” He paused, and<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_235"
        >[235]</span
      >
      moved toward the door. The officer followed him with eyes that expressed
      deep interest. Once more the peddler turned, and seemed to gaze on the
      placid but commanding features of the General with regret and reverence,
      and then, bowing low, he withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      The armies of America and France were led by their illustrious commander
      against the enemy under Cornwallis, and terminated a campaign in triumph
      that had commenced in difficulties. Great Britain soon after became
      disgusted with the war; and the independence of the States was
      acknowledged.

      <h2 class="nobreak">THREE WASHINGTON ANECDOTES</h2>
      <p class="center">Adapted from <span class="smcap">M. L. Weems</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        The original story of little George Washington and his hatchet, together
        with two other doubtful anecdotes not so well known.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      ON A fine morning in the fall of 1737 Mr. Washington, taking little George
      by the hand, went to walk with him in the orchard, promising to show him a
      fine sight. On arriving at the orchard, a fine sight indeed was presented.
      The whole earth, as far as could be seen, was strewed with fruit, and yet
      the trees were bending under the weight of apples which hung in clusters
      like grapes, and vainly strove to hide their blushing cheeks behind the
      green leaves. “Now, George,” said his father, “look here, my son! Don’t
      you remember when a good cousin of yours brought you that fine large apple
      last spring, how hardly I could prevail on you to divide with your
      brothers and sisters; though I promised you that if you would but do it
      God Almighty would give you plenty of apples this fall?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor George could not say a word, but hanging down his head, looked quite
      confused, while with his little naked toes he scratched in the soft
      ground. “Now look up, my son,” continued his father, “look up,
      George,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span> and see there how
      richly the blessed God has made good my promise to you. Wherever you turn
      your eyes you see the trees loaded with fine fruit, many of them indeed
      breaking down; while the ground is covered with mellow apples, more than
      you could eat, my son, in all your lifetime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      George looked in silence on the wide wilderness of fruit. He marked the
      busy humming bees, and heard the gay notes of birds; then, lifting his
      eyes filled with shining moisture, to his father, he softly said, “Well,
      Pa, only forgive me this time, and see if I ever be so stingy any more.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      When George was about six years old he was made the wealthy master of a
      <i>hatchet</i>, of which, like most little boys, he was immoderately fond;
      and was constantly going about chopping everything that came in his way.
      One day, in the garden, where he often amused himself hacking his mother’s
      pea-sticks, he unluckily tried the edge of his hatchet on the body of a
      beautiful young English cherry tree, which he barked so terribly that I
      don’t believe the tree ever got the better of it. The next morning, the
      old gentleman, finding out what had befallen his tree, which, by the by,
      was a great favorite, came into the house; and with much warmth asked for
      the mischievous author, declaring at the same time that he would not have
      taken five guineas for his tree. Nobody could tell him anything about it.
      Presently George and his hatchet made their appearance.<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_238"
        >[238]</span
      >
      “George,” said his father, “do you know who killed that beautiful little
      cherry tree yonder in the garden?” This was a tough question, and George
      staggered under it for a moment; but quickly recovered himself, and
      looking at his father, with the sweet face of youth brightened with the
      inexpressible charm of all-conquering truth, he bravely cried out, “I
      can’t tell a lie, Pa, you know I can’t tell a lie. I did cut it with my
      hatchet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Run to my arms, you dearest boy,” cried his father; “such an act in my
      son is worth more than a thousand trees, though blossomed with silver, and
      their fruits of purest gold.”
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      To startle George into a lively sense of his Maker, his father fell upon
      the following very curious but impressive expedient:
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he went into the garden and prepared a little bed of finely
      pulverized earth, on which he wrote George’s name at full, in large
      letters, then strewing in plenty of cabbage seed, he covered them up, and
      smoothed all over nicely with the roller. This bed he purposely prepared
      close alongside a gooseberry walk, which happening at this time to be well
      hung with ripe fruit, he knew would be honored with George’s visits pretty
      regularly every day. Not many mornings had passed away before in came
      George, with eyes wild rolling and his little cheeks ready to burst with
      great news.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>“Oh, Pa! come here, come
      here!”
    </p>
    <p>“What’s the matter, my son? What’s the matter?”</p>
    <p>
      “Oh, come here, I tell you, Pa: come here, and I’ll show you such a sight
      as you never saw in all your lifetime!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman, suspecting what George would be at, gave him his hand,
      which he seized with great eagerness, and tugging him along through the
      garden, led him point blank to the bed whereon was inscribed, in large
      letters, and in all the freshness of newly sprung plants, the full name of
    </p>
    <p class="center">GEORGE WASHINGTON</p>
    <p>
      “There, Pa!” said George, quite in an ecstasy of astonishment, “did you
      ever see such a sight in all your lifetime?”
    </p>
    <p>“Why, it seems like a curious affair, sure enough, George!”</p>
    <p>“But, Pa, who did make it there? Who did make it there?”</p>
    <p>“It grew there by chance, I suppose, my son.”</p>
    <p>
      “By chance, Pa! Oh, no! no! It never did grow there by chance, Pa. Indeed
      that it never did!”
    </p>
    <p>“Why not, my son?”</p>
    <p>“Why, Pa, did you ever see anybody’s name in a plant bed before?”</p>
    <p>
      “Well, but George, such a thing might happen, though you never saw it
      before.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>“Yes, Pa; but I did never
      see the little plants grow up so as to make one single letter of my name
      before. Now, how could they grow up so as to make <i>all</i> the letters
      of my name, and then standing one after another, to spell <i>my</i> name
      so exactly, and all so neat and even, too, at top and bottom! Oh, Pa, you
      must not say chance did all this. Indeed, <i>somebody</i> did it; and I
      dare say now, Pa, <i>you</i> did it just to scare me, because I am your
      little boy.”
    </p>
    <p>
      His father smiled, and said, “Well, George, you have guessed right. I
      indeed did it; but not to scare you, my son, but to teach you a great
      thing which I wish you to understand. I want, my son, to introduce you to
      your true Father.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Aye! I know well enough whom you mean, Pa. You mean God Almighty, don’t
      you?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, my son, I mean Him indeed. He is your true Father, George, and as my
      son could not believe that chance had made and put together so exactly the
      letters of his name (though only sixteen) then how can he believe that
      chance could have made and put together all those millions and millions of
      things that are now so exactly fitted to his good.”

        How a Philadelphia boy watched the Declaration of Independence in the
        making and celebrated the first Fourth of July on the Eighth.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      PHILADELPHIA in July! Not even the most loyal boy or girl of that good old
      Quaker town but must admit that Philadelphia in July <i>is</i> a hot
      place.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Warm and sunshiny,” were the words that Mr. John Nixon, in his daily
      journal for the year 1776, placed against the early days of July, but I am
      inclined to think that young Joe Nixon was nearer the fact when he called
      it “broiling hot.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Very possibly, however, this slight exaggeration on the part of young Joe
      was due to the fact that he was very busy and therefore very warm. Not
      that he had anything of especial importance to do. Not always those who
      are busiest have the most to do; but you see there was a great deal to
      hear and see in Philadelphia town in the early days of July in the year
      1776 and young Joe Nixon, like a true American boy, felt it his duty to be
      on hand when anything of importance was on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>And so he was continually
      on the go between his uncle’s big house on the Water Street, the room of
      the Committee of Inspection on Second Street, the parade-ground of the
      “Quaker Blues” on the city common, and the big brick State House on
      Chestnut Street.
    </p>
    <p>
      For young Joe Nixon was a privileged character and duly felt his
      importance. His uncle, Mr. John Nixon, was a member of the Committee of
      Safety, and better still, young Joe was a particular favorite of Mr. David
      Rittenhouse who “had charge of the public clock in the State House
      Square.” This put him on good terms with a still more influential
      acquaintance—the doorkeeper of the Continental Congress, then in daily
      session in the Assembly chamber of the State House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Joe was a quick-witted lad and like all the rest of the race of boys
      dearly loved to watch and listen even though he could not always
      understand. Seated by the side of his friend the doorkeeper, he found it
      very interesting and sometimes highly exciting to follow the proceedings
      of the bewigged and earnest gentlemen who were talking, discussing, and
      sometimes getting quite angry with one another on the floor of the
      Congress. Joe only knew in a general sort of way what all this talk and
      discussion meant. But one thing he was certain of, as were all the boys
      and girls in the colonies—and that was that there was a “jolly row” on
      hand between the colonies and the King. He knew, too, that, away off
      toward Boston-town there had been two or three fights with the King’s
      soldiers, in which the troops of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243"
        >[243]</span
      >
      colonies by no means had the worst of it. And he knew, most of all, that
      it was mightily hard just now for a boy to get hold of anything new or
      nice to eat or to wear or to play with and that, somehow, this was all the
      fault of King George the Third, and that the colonies did not propose to
      stand this sort of thing any longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he had made the most of his acquaintance with the doorkeeper of the
      Congress and had witnessed most of the important events that had taken
      place during that lovely Philadelphia June.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had looked with all the awe of a small boy of twelve upon the fifty or
      more gentlemen—the delegates to the Congress—who, representing the
      thirteen colonies, were ranged in a half-circle on either side of Mr.
      Hancock, the President. But I think he admired, even more, the “elegant
      standard, suspended in the Congress Room,” over the door of entrance at
      which he sat with his friend the doorkeeper, and which was “a yellow flag
      with a lively representation of a rattlesnake in the middle in the
      attitude of going to strike, and these words underneath: ‘Don’t tread on
      me!’”
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been in the Congress Room so often that he knew most of the
      delegates by sight and name: that gentleman in the big chair behind the
      heavy mahogany table and the great silver inkstand—the gentleman with the
      scarlet coat and the black velvet breeches—was Mr. John Hancock, the
      President of the Congress—“Rosy John,” the Tory boys called him, much to
      young Joe’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span> ireful
      indignation; that gentleman in the long-waisted white cloth coat, scarlet
      vest and breeches, and white silk hose, was Mr. Jefferson of Virginia;
      that gentleman in the long buff coat and embroidered silk vest was, as of
      course every Philadelphia boy knew, the great Doctor Franklin; and there,
      too, were Mr. Adams and Mr. Gerry of Massachusetts, Mr. Sherman of
      Connecticut, Mr. Clinton of New York, Mr. Stockton of New Jersey, Mr.
      Carroll of Maryland, Mr. Lee of Virginia, Mr. Rutledge of South Carolina,
      and many others whose faces and whose voices had now grown familiar. Even
      his boyish mind, thoughtless of the present and careless of the future
      though it was, had felt the excitement of the moment when on Friday, June
      7th, Mr. Richard Henry Lee of the Virginia colony had risen in his place
      and, “amidst breathless silence,” had read to the Congress this notable
      resolution:
    </p>
    <p>
      “<i>Resolved</i>, that these United Colonies are, and of right ought to
      be, free and independent States, that they are absolved from all
      allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between
      them and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be, totally
      dissolved.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Mr. John Adams of Massachusetts seconded the resolution, Mr. Thomson,
      the secretary, made the official entry in the Journal, the Congress, with
      but few words, postponed its consideration until the next day, and young
      Joe Nixon adjourned with the delegates, like them, half-dazed and
      half-jubilant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>So, through the long June
      days, the Congress argued and debated and hesitated while young Joe
      Nixon—a true type of the restless Young America that is ever in a hurry
      for action and results—watched and wished and wondered, not thinking of
      what might be in the future save that King George was to be thrown
      overboard and the colonies were to set up for a Nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, on June 28th, a committee, consisting of Mr. Jefferson of
      Virginia, Mr. Adams of Massachusetts, Doctor Franklin of Pennsylvania, Mr.
      Sherman of Connecticut, and Mr. Livingston of New York, presented to the
      Congress a long paper which young Joe understood was called a Declaration
      of Independence. And although he thought it was splendid and full of the
      most mightily strong blows against King George, much to the lad’s disgust
      the Congress did not seem to go into ecstasies over it, but hummed and
      hawed and deliberated until July 2d, when Mr. Lee’s original resolution
      was put to vote, carried by the voice of every colony except New York, and
      the United Colonies were declared to be Free and Independent States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Young Joe Nixon, had he dared, would have tossed his little three-cornered
      hat in the air with a loud hurrah, but the gentlemen of the Congress he
      thought seemed strangely quiet about it all. He did not see what their
      wiser heads comprehended, that the vote of the Congress on that second of
      July meant years of struggle against a mighty power—sorrow and privation
      and, perhaps, after all, only defeat and, to the<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_246"
        >[246]</span
      >
      leaders, the disgraceful death of traitors. He saw only the glowing colors
      of victory and excitement as young folks are apt to, and as it is right
      they should.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet that very night, as the Congress adjourned, portly Mr. John Adams,
      with whom the lad was quite a favorite, noticed the ill-concealed
      exultation of the boy and laying a hand upon his head said to him: “A
      great day this, my young friend; a great day, is it not?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, sir,” replied young Joe with energy, “I’m so glad it passed,
      sir.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “And so am I, my lad,” said Mr. Adams, with almost equal enthusiasm; “you
      are a bright and seemly little lad and will not soon forget this day, I’ll
      be bound. So mark my words, my lad. The second of July, 1776, will be the
      most memorable day in all the history of America. It will be celebrated
      ere you grow to manhood, and by succeeding generations, as the great
      anniversary festival, commemorated as the day of deliverance, by solemn
      acts of devotion to God Almighty, from one end of the continent to the
      other, from this time forward for evermore.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sir,” said Joe most respectfully. He did not comprehend all the
      meaning of Mr. Adams’s solemn words, but he was quite as confident as was
      that gentleman that it was a day the anniversaries of which would mean in
      future plenty of fun and jubilee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Mother Nixon could get but little work from her Joe on the following
      morning. And though, in her peaceful Quaker way, she bade him beware of
      too much<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> glorying in all
      the strife and warfare that seemed afoot, I rather suspect that even her
      placid face flushed with quiet enthusiasm as she besought her boy to
      remember that right was always right, and that it was nobler and manlier
      to boldly face whatever might betide than to be as were some men in their
      Quaker town who, so she said, “loved too much their money and their ease,
      and did but make conscience a convenience, instead of being sincerely and
      religiously scrupulous of bearing arms.” All of which meant that there
      were some craven folk in that day of manly protest against tyranny who, to
      save themselves from annoyance, pretended to be Quakers and
      “non-combatants,” when they were only skulking cowards. And all such every
      honest Quaker utterly detested.
    </p>
    <p>
      But young Joe Nixon, too full of the excitement of the moment, paid but
      little regard to his good mother’s words, inasmuch as they did not apply
      to his case; and, hot and panting, fearful lest he should miss something
      new, dashed up to the State House and slipped in beside his friend the
      doorkeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Congress was already in session. Mr. Jefferson’s paper called the
      “Declaration respecting Independence” had been again taken up for
      consideration, and was being soberly debated, paragraph by paragraph.
    </p>
    <p>
      Frequent repetitions had made Joe familiar with some of the phrases in
      this remarkable paper. Even his young heart beat high as he heard some of
      those ringing sentences—about all men being created equal and<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_248"
        >[248]</span
      >
      being “endowed with the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the
      pursuit of happiness”; how that “whenever any form of government becomes
      destructive to these ends it is the right of the people to alter or
      abolish it”; that “the history of the present King of Great Britain is a
      history of repeated injuries and usurpations,” that “a prince whose
      character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit
      to be the ruler of a free people”; that “we must, therefore, hold the
      British people, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in war, in peace
      friends”; that “we, the representatives of the United States of America in
      general Congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world
      for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the name and by the authority
      of the good people of these colonies, solemnly publish and declare that
      these united colonies are and of right ought to be free and independent
      States”; and, lastly, that “for the support of this declaration, with a
      firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge
      to each other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe, as I have said, had felt his young heart glow and his young pulse
      beat under the enthusiasm of these ringing declarations and all this
      debating and questioning appeared to him as fearfully slow and
      faint-hearted; he wondered why, since the Congress had already passed Mr.
      Lee’s resolution of Independence, they should so hesitate over Mr.
      Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence; and, quite frequently, he felt
      compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span> to dash out into
      the hot and sunny street and work off his impatience in a wild and
      purposeless “go-as-you-please” around what was called “Mr. Rittenhouse’s
      Observatory” in the centre of the square.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day dragged on and so did the debate. Even Mr. Jefferson lost patience
      and, confessing that he was “writhing under” all this talk, needed all of
      Doctor Franklin’s philosophy and example to calm him down again. So it is
      not to be wondered at that, late in the afternoon, Joe Nixon, enthusiastic
      young patriot though he was, grew wearied with the talk and the delay and
      determined to go home. But just as he was leaving the building there
      dashed into the State House yard a big chestnut horse covered with foam
      and dust. Its rider, a fine, well-built man in dust-stained travelling
      cloak, sprang from the saddle and, dropping the bridle-rein into Joe’s
      ready hand with a quick, “Here, my lad, take my nag to the City Tavern
      stables, will you?” hurried without further words into the Congress room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joe’s impatience changed to burning curiosity again and, transferring his
      panting charge to another ready lad for attention, he, too, hurried into
      the hall and asked his friend the doorkeeper who this newcomer might be.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Why, lad, ’tis Mr. Cæsar Rodney, don’t you know,” replied the doorkeeper.
      “The delegate from the Counties upon Delaware whom they sent for by
      special post only yesterday, since his colony is divided in action and his
      vote is needful to carry the Declaration through.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>“And did he ride from home
      to-day?” inquired Joe.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Surely, boy,” said the doorkeeper, “clean from the County of Kent, eighty
      miles away. ’Twas a gallant day’s ride and a fair day’s work, for by it is
      independence won.”
    </p>
    <p>
      It was even as he said. Rodney’s glorious ride secured the vote of
      Delaware for the Declaration and late that very night of Wednesday, the
      third of July, by a majority vote of the States—as the colonies now called
      themselves—the immortal paper that we know as the Declaration of
      Independence passed the Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      But before it was handed to the secretary to be engrossed, or copied so
      that it might be signed by all the delegates, Mr. Hancock, as president of
      the Congress, affixed to it his bold signature that we all now know so
      well. And young Joe Nixon had, actually, to stuff his hat into his mouth
      to stifle the hurrah that did so want to burst out when Mr. Hancock,
      rising from his seat, said in his most decided tones:
    </p>
    <p>
      “There! John Bull can read my name without spectacles. Now let him double
      the price on my head, for <i>this</i> is my defiance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the Congress adjourned and young Joe went home, completely tired out
      with the day’s anxiety and excitement. And though on that notable night of
      the third of July a nation had been born, Philadelphia lay quietly asleep
      knowing little or nothing of the great happening.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>Next day—the first Fourth
      of July ever specially known to Americans—Joe was about the only
      privileged character who, slipping into the secret session heard, from his
      seat by the side of his friend the doorkeeper, the order given by Mr.
      Hancock as president of the Congress that “copies of the Declaration be
      sent to the several assemblies, conventions, and committees or Councils of
      Safety, and to the several commanding officers of the Continental troops;
      that it be proclaimed in each of the United States and at the head of the
      army.”
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all that was done on the Fourth of July, 1776, as young Joe Nixon
      could testify. But the printed copies of the Declaration prepared for
      transmission to the several States and to the army and signed by Mr.
      Hancock, the president of the Congress, and by Mr. Thomson, the secretary,
      all bore the heading: “In Congress, July 4, 1776,” and thus that date has
      come down to us as the one to be especially remembered.
    </p>
    <p>
      That very night Joe heard, at his uncle’s big house on the Water Street,
      that the Committee of Safety in Philadelphia—of which, as I have said, Mr.
      John Nixon was a member—had ordered that “the Sheriff of Philadelphia read
      or cause to be read and proclaimed at the State House, in the city of
      Philadelphia, on Monday the 8th day of July instant, at 12 o’clock at noon
      of this same day, the Declaration of the Representatives of the United
      States of America, and that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252"
        >[252]</span
      >
      cause all his officers and the constables of the said city to attend to
      the reading thereof.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Here was a new treat in store for young Joe; and when he learned that the
      Worshipful Sheriff had designated his uncle, Mr. John Nixon, as the
      reader, Joe knew that this meant a front seat for him and was
      appropriately jubilant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day came. Monday, the eighth of July, 1776. “A warm and sunshiny
      morning” again reads the truthful journal, and twelve o’clock, noon, must
      have been hot indeed. But not all the heat of a Philadelphia July could
      wither the ardor of such patriots as young Joe Nixon. He was therefore a
      very “live” portion of the procession which, forming at the hall of the
      Committee of Inspection in Second Street, joined the Committee of Safety
      at their lodge, and, to the stirring sounds of fife and drum, marched into
      the State House square. Out from the rear door of the State House came the
      Congress and other dignitaries and then, standing upon the balcony of Mr.
      Rittenhouse’s astronomical observatory just south of the State House, Mr.
      John Nixon in a voice both loud and clear read to the assembled throng the
      paper which declared the United States of America “Free and Independent.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The reader concluded with the glorious words: “We mutually pledge to each
      other our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor,” and, as his voice
      ceased, the listening throng, so the record says, “broke out into cheers
      and repeated huzzas.” Then the Royal arms<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_253"
        >[253]</span
      >
      were torn down from above the seats of the King’s Judges in the State
      House, and Joe, like a wild young Indian, danced frantically around the
      bonfire which destroyed these “insignia of Royalty.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, at five o’clock, the Declaration was read to the troops then
      present in the town, and the evening was given up to bonfires and
      fireworks which you may be certain young Joe enjoyed to his full content.
    </p>
    <p>
      And peal upon peal, sounding above all the shouts and the hurrahing, rang
      out loud and clear, at both the noon reading and the night’s celebration,
      the joyous clang of the big bell of the State House telling the glad
      tidings of freedom, as well befitted a bell on whose brazen rim men had
      read for twenty-four years the almost prophetic motto:
    </p>
    <p class="center">
      “<i
        >Proclaim liberty through all the land to all the inhabitants
        thereof.</i
      >”
    </p>
    <p>
      To his dying day Joe Nixon never forgot the glory and exultation of that
      jubilant first Independence Day—the eighth of July, 1776.
    </p>
    <p>
      One other notable scene also lived long in his memory—a day and a date new
      to many of us who have always supposed that the Declaration of
      Independence was passed, signed, and proclaimed on the Fourth of July. It
      was the morning of Tuesday, the second of August, that same historic
      summer of 1776. From his customary seat by the doorkeeper Joe saw Mr.
      Thomson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> the secretary of
      the Congress, lay upon the president’s table a great sheet of parchment.
      And on this sheet carefully and beautifully copied was the Declaration of
      Independence. Then, one by one, beginning with Mr. Hancock the president,
      the delegates to the Congress signed the great paper and by that act sent
      their names down to posterity—famous and honored forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the fifty-six signers of the Declaration not all affixed their names to
      the document on that notable second of August. Absentees and new-comers
      added their names as they joined the Congress, and not until the fourth
      day of November, 1776, was the last signature affixed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Names and dates go for but little when a great deed is done. The deed
      itself is of more importance than either names or dates. But to us of this
      second century of the Republic there is both interest and pleasure in
      re-telling the story of liberty and following out by dates, altogether new
      to most of us, the real progress of the historic document that made us a
      nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of one “Fourth of July,” you see, we have really four—The Second
      of July, upon which Mr. Lee’s Resolution of Independence was passed by the
      Congress; the Third of July, upon which the Declaration itself was passed;
      the Fourth of July which witnessed the order for its proclamation, and the
      Second of August upon which it was actually signed by the members of the
      Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>The original document to
      which these names were signed still exists, grown worn and yellow with
      age; the Liberty Bell that rang out the joyous news of freedom on the
      sunny noon and the starlit night of the eventful eighth of July is now
      cracked and voiceless; the signers themselves are now only names and
      memories; but their work lives in the power and glory of the great nation
      which they founded, and every true American girl and boy honors the memory
      and applauds the courage of those devoted men. And upon each recurring
      Fourth of July every girl and boy in the land is as joyous and jubilant a
      young patriot as was even young Joe Nixon when, with bonfire and rude,
      old-time fireworks, with hurrah and shout and song he celebrated, in the
      days when George the Third was king, the first Fourth of July on the
      Eighth.

        A grandfather tells a group of patriotic little Americans how
        <i>his</i> grandfather was a redcoat at Lexington.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      TOOT! Toot! Rub-a-dub-dub! came from down the street, and it made Grandpa
      Sturdy, who sat dozing in the sun, start up suddenly and look to see what
      gallant soldiers were coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      First came Captain Tommy Rankin, acting as drum-major, with his sister’s
      muff worn for a fur hat, and an umbrella for a baton. Behind him came a
      troop of children wearing all sorts of military decorations—helmets,
      epaulets, and paper caps. One boy carried a large flag, and one of the
      girls was singing through a comb.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandpa rose and went out to the gate as they came near. Then, just as
      they came close, he took off his hat and gave them a military salute—for
      grandpa was a soldier once—and held up his hand for them to stop just a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Company, halt!” commanded Tommy, in a loud tone. “Parade, rest! Salute!
      Attention!” And they obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>“What company is this?”
      said grandpa smilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      “We are the minute-men, grandpa,” said Tommy. “We are going out to Concord
      to keep Flag Day. Our teacher was going to have a celebration to-day, but
      she is sick, so we have made a procession, and are going to march by her
      house to show her how we can remember the flag.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s right,” said grandpa, saluting the flag. “I can do that if my
      grandfather was what we call a redcoat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Your grandfather a redcoat?” cried all the boys in a breath. “Did he ever
      tell you anything about it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh, yes, he told us about going to America to fight the rebels, and what
      a lot of British soldiers there were in Boston, who all laughed at the
      idea of the plain country farmers and workmen being able to fight the
      king’s own fine troops; and granddad thought so with all the rest, he
      said. Well, they found out that day that the rebels could fight, after
      all. Let me see, what day was that, boys?”
    </p>
    <p>“April 19, 1775,” said Tommy, echoed by the others.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, yes. You have got that learned, haven’t you? Grandfather said that
      all through that long, hard march from Concord back to Boston they were
      fighting. They were ashamed to be beaten by those they had made fun of.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Every stone wall, every large rock or tree seemed to have an American
      behind it. He said it was wonderful how those farmers could shoot. Dozens
      of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span> Englishmen fell and
      died there in the road. Granddad told us how they struggled on, tired,
      wounded, thirsty, and almost ready to give up. Finally most of them got
      back to Charlestown, and were safe. But all day long, and most of the
      night before, they had had to march.
    </p>
    <p>
      “And they didn’t do what they went out for, either, for the Americans had
      carried off the guns and powder they went to destroy. The night before
      they marched out gaily enough, expecting to have no trouble, and only a
      trip into the country in the fine spring air.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the trip became a terrible battle, and began a great war. And ever
      since America and England have been two separate nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Grandfather went back to England very soon, and as he couldn’t march and
      fight any more, he got a pension from the king and stayed in England all
      his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He liked America, and always said that now there was peace, and the new
      country promised so much, he would like to go there to live; but he never
      did. My father brought us over, though, when I was sixteen. So I am an
      American, if my grandfather was one of the redcoats who fought at
      Lexington in America.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’d rather have a grandfather that was a minute-man,” said one of the
      boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Perhaps the great-grandfathers of some of you fought the redcoats,” said
      Grandpa Sturdy. “But I am not ashamed to tell you that my grandfather wore
      one of the king’s red-and-white uniforms and carried<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_259"
        >[259]</span
      >
      a British gun. The soldiers were doing their duty bravely enough. It was
      the king and the men with him who were to blame for the battle. Well,
      boys, march on again, march along. Stand up for your flag. It is my flag,
      too, and I love it. Always be ready to be minute-men for the flag.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Attention, company! Carry arms! Forward, march!” shouted the captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Away went the procession to the teacher’s house, their flags waving gaily
      and the flowers they were carrying nodding their heads, while Grandpa

      <p>
        A boy’s story by a boy’s author, telling of a thrilling escape from
        “Tarleton’s men.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      “FATHER’S escaped! Moses has just brought me word,” said John Russell, as
      he ran to the steps of the broad veranda. His mother quickly rose from her
      chair and looked down at the eager boy on the steps below her. Her slight
      figure was trembling, and a bright red spot had appeared on each cheek.
    </p>
    <p>“Are you sure, John?” she asked, in a low tone.</p>
    <p>
      “Yes, sure! It seems that the British escort had gone but halfway to
      Charleston when a band of five Whigs met them. They had a bit of an
      argument, and the upshot of it was that father made off. Strange about
      these Whigs happening to meet them, wasn’t it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      John, unable to restrain his feelings longer, threw his hat high in the
      air, and rushing up the steps, seized his “little mother” in his arms and
      began to dance with her about the porch.
    </p>
    <p>“What’s that you say? Your father’s escaped?”</p>
    <p>
      John quickly released his mother and turned to face<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_261"
        >[261]</span
      >
      the gruff-voiced Captain Heald of the British service, who had just come
      out of the open door. The boy’s manner instantly changed, although he
      could not conceal his exultation as he replied: “Yes, sir; he’s escaped!
      He had no fancy to spend any more time in the ‘provost’ at Charleston. It
      isn’t a fit place for vermin, to say nothing of human beings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I ought to have hanged him, and you, too!” replied the captain. “It’s the
      only way to deal with such rebels!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hanging, sir,” said John, “seems the thing your party do best; unless you
      have a still stronger fancy for quartering yourselves on your betters.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Fine parole you’ve kept!” sneered the captain. “I’ll warrant, if the
      truth were known, you yourself had a share in this escape of your father.”
    </p>
    <p>“I’m under no parole not to help my father to freedom,” said John.</p>
    <p>
      The captain looked at him angrily a moment, and then, without making any
      further reply, turned and went down the steps and across the lawn to join
      some of the soldiers who were quartered on the plantation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I beg you to be careful, John,” said his mother anxiously, when they were
      alone again. “You know that man can do whatever he pleases here.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “No,” replied John, “he cannot frighten me with his bluster and his red
      coat.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But you must not provoke him. Tarleton has given him full command in this
      district, and he has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
      already committed outrages that no British regular officer would venture
      on.”
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the war in that region was largely a conflict of partisans native
      to the soil, and Tory Americans often committed against Whig Americans
      high-handed acts from which officers accustomed to the procedure of
      military law would have shrunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Very well,” said John, laughing to reassure his mother. “He hasn’t any
      great cause for liking me, that’s a fact. I’ve let the pigs out of the
      pens and scared away the chickens, and told the negroes where to hide some
      of the stuff in the barns. But this last work is the worst—this sending
      word, as I did, by Moses to Dick Eddy to look out for father when he
      passed. Heald will never forgive me for that. I’m not afraid, though,” he
      added, as he left his mother and followed the captain across the lawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even in his excitement the beautiful summer day had an influence to soothe
      him. All about him lay the fertile lands of Ridgefield, his father’s
      plantation, one of the most beautiful in all the South. Behind him was the
      great house in which he had been born, flanked by the quarters of the
      negroes and the spacious barns. Off on the left was a grove, and below the
      hill was the slow stream. John would have felt the sweet influences of the
      hour more but for the presence of thirty men in scarlet, who now were the
      virtual masters of the place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a week earlier Captain Heald had somehow<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_263"
        >[263]</span
      >
      gained information that Major Russell and his son had left Sumter’s army
      for a brief visit home, so the Tory band had at once swooped down and
      captured both. John had been left on parole, and his father had escaped;
      but Ridgefield was now occupied by “Tarleton’s men,” and all its beauty
      for John was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped and watched the guards doing “sentry go” in the road and out by
      the grove beyond the house, and the longer he watched them the more
      helpless and angry he felt. “Great liberty this!” he muttered. “Shut up
      here like a pig in a pen! Not that there are many pigs left here now,” he
      added, smiling grimly. “Oh, well, I hope father’ll do something, now that
      he’s got away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “John,” said his mother, when he returned to the house, “Captain Heald is
      going to leave.”
    </p>
    <p>“Good for Captain Heald! When is he going?”</p>
    <p>“To-night. Lieutenant Mott is to be left in charge here.”</p>
    <p>“He’s not as bad as the other. Where’s the captain going?”</p>
    <p>“I think over to Fort Granby.”</p>
    <p>
      “Humph! Probably to set some one on father’s tracks. He’ll never get him,
      though. Hello! Here comes the captain now, and he’s all dressed to leave!”
    </p>
    <p>
      A colored man soon brought the captain’s horse, and as the officer swung
      himself lightly into the saddle, John, taking off his hat and bowing low,
      called out: “Good-bye, captain! We’ll speed the parting guest, although we
      can’t welcome the coming!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Captain Heald made no
      reply, but turned on John a threatening look, at which the boy laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day went by and on the following morning John was wandering about the
      place, idly watching the soldiers, longing to be with his father, and
      wishing he had not given his parole to stay on the plantation. A black
      servant came to him and said that his mother wished to speak with him at
      the house. He went, and found his mother at the door. An expression of
      agony was on her face.
    </p>
    <p>“What is it mother?” he asked.</p>
    <p>“Go up to your room, John, and I’ll tell you.”</p>
    <p>
      The boy ran swiftly up the stairs, and held the door of his room open for
      his mother to enter. She closed and locked the door behind her, and then,
      handing him a letter, said: “I found this in the dining-room after
      Lieutenant Mott left the breakfast-table.”
    </p>
    <p>John took the letter from his mother’s hand and read:</p>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p class="right">Fort Granby, August 6, 1780.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="smcap">Lieutenant Mott</span>. Upon receipt of this, you
        will at once take and hang that young rebel, John Russell. He has
        violated his parole and is entitled neither to a further hearing nor a
        trial. Hang him before sunset to-night. I shall expect to receive word
        by to-morrow morning.—<span class="smcap">Heald.</span>
      </p>
    </div>
    <p>
      John’s face turned deadly pale, then red with anger. “I have not broken my
      parole!” he cried. “I never gave a promise that I would not help father to
      escape. This is murder, and——”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>“I think Lieutenant Mott
      dropped that letter in the dining-room intentionally,” broke in his
      mother. “He’s not as bad as Captain Heald. He won’t carry out the order.”
    </p>
    <p>
      With a great effort John controlled his voice. “We’ll see, mother. If it
      is really an order, I suppose he’ll have to carry it out—unless I escape.”
    </p>
    <p>“He might let you escape.”</p>
    <p>“No, little mother. But don’t give up. I’ll find a way out.”</p>
    <p>
      He kissed his mother, unlocked the door and walked slowly down the stairs
      and out upon the veranda. Lieutenant Mott was coming up the steps, and as
      he met John he gave him a keen glance of sympathy. But that was all. Not a
      word or sign to show that he would not carry out his order.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hanged!</i> The very crickets seemed to be chirping it. Over and over
      the word kept repeating itself in John’s mind as he walked slowly on over
      the lawn. He saw that now he was no longer bound by his parole. His word
      of honor had held him, but the order to hang him released him from the
      bond. He would escape if he could, but wherever he went red-coated
      soldiers were lounging lazily about, and up and down the road marched the
      sentries with their muskets over their shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were only night! In the darkness he might escape, but it was not yet
      noon. The very words of the letter came back to him. “Hang him before
      sunset to-night!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>And this was to be the end
      of it all! To be hanged! It was too horrible to think of. Every avenue of
      escape was blocked, and in sheer desperation he returned to the house and
      made his way noiselessly up the stairs to his room. His mother was not
      there, and relieved by the thought that she was not present to look upon
      him in his weakness, he bolted the door and seated himself by the table on
      which stood a miniature of her. He looked at it, and dropping his head
      upon his arms on the table before him, he sobbed in an agony of despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was roused by the sound of the dinner-bell. He must go down and somehow
      conceal his feelings. He bathed his face and, somewhat relieved by his
      tears, arose to join the family in the room below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only his sisters were there when he entered, and he knew at once by the
      expression upon their faces that his mother had not shown the letter to
      them. He choked down a few mouthfuls of food, but he could not eat.
      Excusing himself from the table on the plea that he wished to find his
      mother, he ran swiftly up to her room and rapped upon the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had to repeat his summons before it was opened, and then it was only
      far enough to enable his mother to see who the visitor was. Then she drew
      him inside, and quickly closed and bolted the door again.
    </p>
    <p>
      John almost broke down when he looked at her, so woful and desperate was
      her expression. He must cheer her with some hope, and his own courage
      revived at the cheerful tone which he assumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>“Little mother, none of
      the Russells were ever hanged, and I shall not be the first.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “What will you do, my son?” Her voice sounded as if it were far away, and
      John looked up quickly as he replied: “I shall make a break for it, if I
      must. I’d rather be shot in trying to get away than be hanged.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You are my own brave laddie,” said his mother, rising. “Do your best,
      John; but if you have to——”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I know, I know,” he murmured, as for one moment he returned her frantic
      embrace; and then, not daring to look back, he left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      After crossing the lawn he seated himself beneath a spreading tree to
      collect his thoughts and survey the place. Everything was as it had been.
      The guards were marching up and down in the road; the idle soldiers were
      lounging about the tents; the locusts were calling in the trees, and peace
      apparently was over all.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’ll have to try it. They may come for me any time now,” he thought,
      suddenly rising and starting toward the guard in the upper road. He could
      feel that his mother was watching him, but he dared not look toward her
      windows. The testing time had come and now it was to be a struggle for
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked leisurely up the road, although his heart was beating furiously.
      He would try not to attract attention, and it was no unusual thing for him
      to join the men on guard. They all knew he was on parole, and besides,
      there were the guns if he should try to get away.
    </p>
    <p>“It’s hot to-day, Tom,” he said, as he approached.</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>“You’d think it was if you
      had to carry a gun up and down this dusty road.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I’d be glad to relieve you, Tom. You rest a bit, while I take your
      place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “That’s kind of you,” laughed the guard, “but I fear it won’t do, sir,”
      and he passed on, while John seated himself to await his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced at the soldiers in the tents near by. How easily they could
      reach him, and only one word would bring them all after him! But he must
      take his chances. There was no other way, and when the guard turned his
      back again he would try it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a little, lean, half-starved pig came out of the woods and stood
      for a moment stupidly staring at the boy before him. “Poor fellow!”
      thought John. “You’re in the same box with me. Tarleton’s men will treat
      us alike.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up and saw the returning guard. The pig saw him, too, and as if
      inspired by a sudden fear, he gave a startled grunt and darted swiftly up
      the road.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, sir, help me catch the pig!” shouted the guard, starting swiftly in
      pursuit of the runaway. “He’s the last on the place.”
    </p>
    <p>
      John needed no second invitation, and in a moment he and the guard were
      following the pig, which was running as if he knew his life was in danger.
      The soldiers rushed from their tents, and stood laughing and cheering the
      pursuers. To them it was a comedy to see the sentry and the prisoner
      striving to catch one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
      poor, little half-starved pig; but to John the pursuit had all the
      elements of a tragedy. Life or death lay in the outcome for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He flung aside his hat and coat, and put forth all his strength. Dripping
      with perspiration, streaked with dust, almost breathless he sped on and
      on. Once he came close upon the frightened pig, but he took good care to
      fall upon him in such a manner that the little “porker” only emitted a
      terrified squeal and redoubled his speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Hold! hold!” shouted the guard, who was behind now. “Let him go. We can’t
      catch him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      John glanced quickly back, and saw that he was out of the range of the
      soldiers’ muskets. His speed increased as he realized that the supreme
      moment had come at last. Only the gun of the guard was to be feared now.
    </p>
    <p>“Halt!” shouted the guard again. “Stop, or I shoot!”</p>
    <p>
      John only drew his head down between his shoulders. His heart almost
      ceased to beat. The report of the gun rang out, and he almost fell to the
      ground as he heard the bullet whistle over his head.
    </p>
    <hr class="tb" />
    <p>
      A few days afterward, when he was with his father in Sumter’s army near
      Camden, just before the terrible battle, and for the second time had been
      relating the story of his escape, he added, “That little porker did a
      double duty. He saved his bacon, and he saved mine, too.”

    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        The tale of a Tory maid, a Patriot youth, and a kettle of scarlet dye.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      IN 1774-5, previous to the outbreak of the Revolution, the Callendars were
      Royalists, and General Gage’s young British officers, one of whom was
      related to the Callendars, frequently rode out from Boston to call at the
      hospitable country-house. It was Polly Callendar whom they went to see;
      her beauty and vivacious wit were the theme of many toasts. And up to the
      evening of this story Polly was as disdainful of the “minute-men” as was
      her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      At about noon of that day Madam Callendar was summoned to the bedside of
      Elizabeth Ballard, a kinswoman living near Natick. She had left her brick
      oven full of the week’s baking, and had set a large brass kettle, filled
      with redwood dye, on the crane in the great fireplace. Madam Callendar’s
      parting directions to Polly had been not only to watch the oven, but to
      stir the boiling redwood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Numerous skeins and hanks of woolen yarn, spun during the previous winter,
      were immersed in it, and the last warning from Polly’s mother was:
      “Redwood<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">[271]</span> must never be
      hurried, Polly. Stir often, lass. Press the hanks down hard with your
      clothes-stick, and then drop in a little of this powdered alum to set the
      scarlet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      So through the long, foggy afternoon it was Polly Callendar’s homely task
      to watch the oven and tend the “scarlet kettle.” But with evening came an
      unexpected diversion. A knock was heard at the outer door; and when old
      Rastus, the negro servant, had opened it, a tall young man, in provincial
      garb, inquired how far it was to Boston and what was the road. Learning
      that the distance was still considerable, he entreated hospitality, saying
      that having ridden since dawn, he was both tired and wet. Polly at first
      demurred, but in the end, moved by his plight and persuaded somewhat by
      his respectful manners and handsome face, she sent Rastus to stable the
      horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      She spread a plentiful supper before the wayfarer; and then, because his
      appearance pleased her, she brewed for him some of her mother’s cherished
      tea, and poured it into one of the delicate china teacups that had come
      from England.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the young man ate in silence, notwithstanding these attentions. Truth
      to say, he was ill at ease. He was on his way to join the minute-men, and
      he was bringing with him a hundred pounds that had been contributed by the
      “patriot committee” of his native town. He feared that in some way the
      redcoats had been given a hint of his mission. Mounted men had stared hard
      at him that day, and he had thought it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272"
        >[272]</span
      >
      wise to avoid a troop patrolling the roads. And now, despite the quality
      of his supper, he paused to listen anxiously whenever horses’ hoofs or
      voices were heard without. Polly, noticing his uneasiness and marking his
      blue colonial home-spun, drew her own inferences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of a sudden the young man took note of the kettle and its scarlet
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      “That is a bright dye which you have there, mistress,” he remarked. “Are
      you fond of so high a color?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “In good truth, sir, and why not?” replied Polly. “Have you fault to find
      with it?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I would be but a churl, an I did,” answered the guest gallantly, “since
      it is scarcely more pink than the cheeks of my fair hostess.
    </p>
    <p>“The redcoats must feel flattered at your preference,” he added.</p>
    <p>
      “And is it not the hue that all loyal subjects should prefer?” queried
      Polly demurely.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, but I will not gainsay you, mistress,” replied the young man. “And
      yet,” he added, “it is a color soon to fade under our American sun.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But not from the hearts of the king’s loyal subjects,” retorted Polly.
      “This is no rebel household, sir. My kinsmen, who were here but yesterday,
      wear the scarlet and are the king’s loyal servants.” And saying this she
      observed her guest closely and saw that he winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Beyond doubt he is one of the patriots,” she thought.<span

      “But such a handsome youth! Moreover, he is most courteous, and his voice
      and ways are more gentle and respectful than those of Cousin Charles.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As for the stranger, his heart sank afresh. “I will pay for my supper and
      get on,” he thought. “I shall be safer abroad in the darkness than here.”
      And he rose to take leave as gently as he might, but at that moment the
      tramp of horses was again heard; and this time they did not pass, but
      pulled up before the house door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “My kinsmen, it is very like,” said Polly, smiling. “They wear sharp
      swords, sir.” Then, as she noted the hunted look which the young man cast
      about the room, her light and taunting manner changed. “Is it that you
      would not like to meet them, sir?” she asked, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she spoke there came an imperative rap at the outer door, and a cry of
      “Open in the king’s name!”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For heaven’s sake, mistress, show me some way out,” cried the stranger.
      “It is less that I fear their swords, but I am on a mission of
      importance.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Open, madam! Open, Polly! It is I, your Cousin Charles; and they say
      there is a rascally rebel here!” cried the voice outside. “But we have the
      house surrounded.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Polly had turned toward a rear door, but hearing these last words, darted
      to the centre of the room again. For an instant she was at a loss. Then
      her eyes fell on the door of her mother’s storeroom, a closet beside<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_274"
        >[274]</span
      >
      the large chimney, which it was Madam Callendar’s practice always to keep
      locked; but in the haste of departing that day she had forgotten to take
      the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Here, sir,” Polly whispered. “Quick, be quick!” and she unlocked the
      door, half pushed the man within and hastily turning the key again, put it
      in her pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Open! Open!” cried the voices outside. “Open in the king’s name!” and the
      raps were repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Coming, good sirs, coming,” cried Polly. Then her eye fell on the young
      patriot’s greatcoat lying across the back of a chair. If seen, that would
      betray all. She snatched it up and plunged it into the great kettle of
      scarlet dye. Then throwing the door open and courtesying low, as was the
      custom of those days, she cried: “Good-evening, Cousin Charles. Welcome,
      good gentlemen. My mother has gone to Natick for the day. Ne’theless you
      are right welcome.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ay!” grumbled the young officer. “After my knuckles are skinned with
      knocking. But prithee, Polly, have you seen naught of this insolent
      knave?”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Indeed, Cousin Charles, this is but a sorry jest!” exclaimed Polly
      Callendar. “Since when has my family been aught but loyal to the king?”
    </p>
    <p>“True,” assented the Briton. “Yet the rascal may be lurking about.”</p>
    <p>
      “Enter, then, and see for yourselves,” cried Polly. “My mother would
      earnestly desire you to purge her house of rebels!”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span>They came noisily in—while
      the young patriot’s heart beat fast—they peered into nooks and corners,
      and presently ascended to the attic.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do not forget the cellar!” cried Polly gaily, opening the door and
      handing her cousin a lighted candle. “Perchance the knave is hiding in
      some bin or box.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The quest there proved as fruitless as in the chambers; but on emerging
      one of the party noted the closed door by the chimney and tried it. “Why
      locked?” he exclaimed. “The key, fair mistress.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “For that you will do well to ask my mother,” replied Polly carelessly.
      “The closet is my mother’s keeping-room; and it is ever her custom to
      carry the key in her pocket.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “True,” remarked her cousin, who knew the ways of the household. “The
      rogue will hardly have got into madam’s keeping-room. Doubtless he has
      slipped away.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “If ever he were here,” flashed back Polly. “But beyond doubt, good cousin
      and gentlemen, you must be hungry after your hard ride. Will you not
      partake of our cheer?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing loath, the young redcoats gathered about the supper-table, where
      for an hour or more Polly maintained the reputation of the house for
      loyalty and good entertainment. In truth, the soldiers were slow to
      depart, and would hardly have gone by nine o’clock had not Polly adroitly
      reminded her kinsmen that the “Knave” they were pursuing would surely get
      clear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">[276]</span> away. Thereupon they
      took leave and rode off with much laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But fearful lest they might return, Polly waited long listening, and not
      until old Rastus had come in to bar the outer door for the night and close
      the shutters would she release her prisoner.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Come forth, sir,” she at last commanded, with assumed austerity. “What
      have we here? A rebel, I fear me, from all I am told.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But one profoundly grateful to his preserver,” replied the young man; and
      to old Rastus’s great astonishment he took Mistress Polly’s hand and
      gallantly kissed the tips of her fingers, albeit they were tinged with
      scarlet from her dye.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Methinks, sir, it but ill becomes me to accept such thanks from one who
      confesses his disloyalty to King George,” Polly replied, still with
      seeming severity, “and whose name I do not even know. But since you are
      here, prithee take seat before the fire. For of necessity, sir, I have
      made a good Royalist of you, so far as your greatcoat covers you. See!”
      And with the clothes-stick she lifted the coat out of the kettle. “Not
      Cousin Charles’s own is a brighter scarlet!”
    </p>
    <p>The stranger burst into a hearty laugh.</p>
    <p>“Good faith, I had not thought to wear a scarlet coat!” he exclaimed.</p>
    <p>
      “Yet, sir, it may stand you in good stead as you ride into Boston
      to-morrow,” replied Polly. “It was of that I thought as I dipped it. And
      now let us powder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> a little
      alum in the mortar to set the hue. I would not have thy loyalty wash out,
      sir, in the first shower that falls on you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      As a consequence, one young patriot found himself powdering alum to dye
      his own coat scarlet. And midnight came and passed as he and Polly sat in
      front of the great brass kettle, and old Rastus nodded in the corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond doubt they became better acquainted in this time; and Polly
      certainly learned the stranger’s name, for as the tall old clock in the
      corner struck one, she said, “It is now time to wring thy coat, John
      Fenderson.”
    </p>
    <p>
      When wrung, it had still to be dried; and Polly put it for an hour into
      the warm brick oven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhat puckered from the dye, the garment still required pressing out;
      and to heat a sad-iron and accomplish this occupied yet another hour. The
      old clock struck three.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Truly, John Fenderson, making a king’s man of thee has been a long task!”
      exclaimed Polly, as at last she held up the scarlet coat for inspection.
      “Don it, sir! I would even desire to mark the effect.” And what John
      Fenderson would not have done at the king’s command he appears now to have
      done without hesitation at Polly Callendar’s request. For between these
      two young people the grievous differences of Tory and Patriot had already
      been dispelled—in the dyeing of a coat before a fireplace.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">[278]</span>“Good luck, John
      Fenderson, in thy brave coat,” said Polly at four o’clock, as the young
      man took leave, after she had given him breakfast. “May the color hold,”
      she added. “But if it fades——”
    </p>
    <p>“I shall come back to you,” said John.</p>
    <p>
      “Ah, but it will grieve me when I hear that thou art to be hanged for a
      rebel!” cried Polly from the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Nay, Mistress Polly, I should have but to send for thee to teach me how
      to dye!” replied John Fenderson.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he rode away, and had cause to be thankful for the disguise the coat
      offered him; for while riding through Newton a little before noon, he was
      hailed by three redcoats, two of whom raised their muskets; but the third
      held them back, saying, “Nay, by his coat he must be one of our men.”
    </p>
    <p>
      There is much reason to believe that Mistress Polly’s loyalty to King
      George was ever afterward open to question. At any rate, the records of
      John Fenderson’s native town show that he married in 1779, and that the
      bride’s name was Polly Callendar.

      <p>
        A boy in General Greene’s army sets out to capture a famous Tory
        marauder and finds him to be his own brother. What does he do?
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      IN THE early days of March, 1781, Neil Davidson was thirteen years old and
      had been five months in the patriot army. He had taken part in several
      skirmishes and had lived in camps where food was scarce and clothing
      scarcer, where a blanket for four men was a prize, and companies were
      sometimes obliged to stay away from review because their uniform had been
      worn through to that of mother nature. He had shared the hard marches by
      which Greene and Morgan kept the prisoners taken at Cowpens from recapture
      by Cornwallis, and during which Greene had reported that the naked feet of
      his men marked their way with blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a strange experience for a boy, and Neil had become such a queer
      combination of outspoken child and shrewd veteran as can be matched in
      these days only by the gamins who fight their battles in the city streets.
      Without losing his boyishness he had acquired a military swagger which he
      knew enough to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> suppress
      when there was any advantage to be gained by acting like a child, and
      underneath swagger and boyishness there burned the revengeful, deep-seated
      hatred of Tories which marked all but a few of the patriots of those days.
      In Neil it was an unchildlike passion, giving him strength on long
      marches, putting a keen barb to his wit, making him trusted in the army
      beyond his years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the real beginning of the Revolution his father had been hanged by
      the Tory government for taking part in a popular outbreak, and his mother
      had been crazed by grief. From the shadow of such an early childhood Neil
      had emerged almost a man in purpose at thirteen and very fierce at heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet, in spite of a bronzed face, he was still exceedingly coltish and
      immature in appearance, with round, wide-open blue eyes, a shock of long,
      sunburned hair, and legs that also were long and sunburned, having seldom
      been covered by a substantial, untorn garment. There was a great amount of
      speed available in the bare legs, and under the shock of hair there was
      plenty of boyish logic and common sense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether, he was handy to have about, and he was sent on so many errands
      from officer to officer that he was known around all the cheerless
      campfires in Greene’s army. Even the general kept him in mind, and at
      times permitted him to undertake important missions. He had carried more
      than one of the appeals for reënforcements which Greene kept sending
      to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">[281]</span> the governors of North
      and South Carolina and Virginia, and to the military leaders of the three
      states. His way had lain through a country swarming with enemies, and he
      had come safely through encounters in which a man’s errand would have been
      investigated.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, during the anxious two weeks before the Battle of Guilford
      Court House, Greene sent for him again. The army was moving stealthily
      along muddy roads through the dusk of starlight, for the general thought
      his force still too weak to risk an engagement and evaded Cornwallis by
      shifting his camp every twenty-four hours, in the dark. The footsore men
      plodded forward silently. Loss of sleep was wearing them out. Greene
      himself had hardly slept for a week, and physical exhaustion united with
      his judgment in declaring that the strain could not last much longer. If
      sufficient reënforcements did not arrive soon, he would have to fight
      without them, and disaster would result. He sighed and settled himself
      wearily in the saddle. For a moment his overburdening anxiety slipped from
      him, and he dozed as he rode. Then he straightened himself with a start. A
      small lanky figure had bobbed up beside his horse out of the obscurity of
      the night, and he caught the motion of a salute.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, Neil,” he said, “I sent for you to see if you are ready to undertake
      another dangerous errand. I fear my last message to Colonel William
      Campbell has been intercepted. I want some one to go out, try to meet<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_282"
        >[282]</span
      >
      him, and hurry him forward. If he has not heard of our recent movements,
      he may be marching toward the Dan River.”
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment, as if he had more to say, but Neil did not wait for
      it. “I’m your man, sir!” he declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general smiled at the boy’s confidence. “That was my impression, too,”
      he admitted. “Yet there is one strong argument against your going.
      Gillespie, one of the scouts, has just come in. He’s been hanging around
      Tarleton’s Legion and he’s heard you spoken of. It seems that the enemy
      took notice of you in the affair at the mill the other day, and that
      rascal who has your name, Davidson, the bushwhacker, is with the Legion,
      and he swears to capture you; so if any of Tarleton’s men come across a
      boy of your size and description, he will have hard work to get away from
      them.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “But even if they are on the lookout for a boy, they’re just as much on
      the lookout for every grown man in your army,” Neil urged. “Anybody that
      the Tories get hold of will have to give a good account of himself.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “So I reasoned,” the general said, “and at the same time I am unwilling to
      have you undertake this without some safeguard. You are about the height
      of an ordinary young woman, and when we reach Mrs. Bynum’s plantation,
      where we shall make our next camp, I shall have her furnish you with
      clothing and a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>
      side-saddle, and you will go disguised as a girl. That is all for the
      present. Report to me at the Bynum house as soon as you reach the
      plantation, and keep this to yourself in the meantime.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil saluted and dropped back. As soon as he was at a safe distance he
      gave a long whistle of surprise. Then he began to laugh. The dismay with
      which he first thought of concealing his military identity in petticoats
      gave way to excitement. He began softly to hum the air and words of a rude
      ballad which celebrated the victory of King’s Mountain, five months
      before, and was passing from mouth to mouth through the patriot army.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Stop that singing!” a gruff voice said in his ear. “Are you signalling to
      Cornwallis?”
    </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness it was impossible to see if the speaker were officer or
      man from the ranks. Neil took the risk and answered like an equal: “Who
      are you that are giving me orders? I left General Greene ahead there, and
      just now I’m taking orders direct from him.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Oh!” the voice returned ironically, but without apparent offense, “then I
      reckon you’re the great Neil Davidson. I’m merely Joe Gillespie, scout.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I have heard of you,” Neil said good-naturedly. “The general was speaking
      of you just now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Do you know who was speaking of you lately?” Gillespie asked. He took the
      boy by the arm and walked along with him through the dark. “That namesake
      of yours, Sandy Davidson. He’s taken a notion<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_284"
        >[284]</span
      >
      to capture you, and you want to be as wary as you know how. He’s the worst
      of the Tory bushwhackers, and the most daredevil. If he’s decided to
      capture you because your name’s the same as his, he’s likely to walk right
      into Greene’s camp and do it. It’s nothing to him that there’s a reward
      out for his life.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I reckon he’ll not find it as easy to catch me as he thinks,” Neil said.
      A tremor of fierceness came into his voice. He threw back his shoulders,
      and his companion could feel his arm grow tense. “But if I live long
      enough I’ll capture him and see him hanged. He has my brother’s name.”
    </p>
    <p>“The name is common.”</p>
    <p>
      “It shan’t be common among Tories!” the boy declared. “They killed my
      brother. They shan’t have his name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “How did they kill him?” Gillespie’s voice was stirred. It was an old
      story, the loss of life on either side in the bitter Civil War that tore
      the Carolinas, but it was a story that never found dull ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      “I don’t know,” Neil said. “I was a very little boy and the Indians had
      carried me off. When I was exchanged and brought home my mother told me
      that the Tories had killed Sandy. She didn’t say how—she never would tell
      me how. She’d had so much trouble that she was—well, queer, and she never
      would tell anything very much. I was so scared and lonesome that I ran
      away to the Indians, and stayed with them again a long time. Mother was
      just the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> when I came
      back. She didn’t need me and I couldn’t do anything for her, and that’s
      why I followed the army to fight the Tories in Sandy’s place. And I don’t
      intend to let any Tory live with his name.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Gillespie had been seasoned in border warfare, yet he felt uncomfortable
      at hearing a mere child use the fierce language of the war. “Pshaw, now,”
      he said, “it’s an ugly business to plan to kill men one at a time! When a
      whole army gets up before you and you shoot at it, that’s a different
      matter. And you want to be careful; besides, he’s a good deal more likely
      to get hold of you and do what he pleases with you than you are with him.”
    </p>
    <p>“I’ll be careful,” Neil agreed—“careful to capture him.”</p>
    <p>
      There were so many things to occupy the general’s attention that it was
      nearly daybreak before the messenger was despatched; but at last, with his
      length and thinness encased in linsey-woolsey petticoats and a sunbonnet
      on his head, the boy rode off through the cold morning chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Neil started the sunbonnet had been ripped open, and Greene had
      slipped a letter to Colonel Campbell in between the lining and one of the
      slats which stiffened its brim. Neil was as conscious of the letter as he
      was of the rattling of the bonnet round his ears and of the imprisoned
      feeling which it gave him to wear it. The general had told him to treat
      the bonnet carelessly if he fell into trouble; to swing it by the<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_286"
        >[286]</span
      >
      strings as a girl might, and to swing it into a fire if possible; but for
      the first hour Neil was in no trouble except from the bonnet and the
      petticoats and the necessity of sitting sidewise on his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was riding through woodland; day began to sift slowly down among the
      dark tree-trunks. The branches above him grew astir with wakening birds;
      the cold air was sweet from unseen jasmine flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world seemed so quiet, and there was such a sense of peace abroad,
      that Neil did one of the few imprudent things of his service. His
      side-saddle continually troubled him; he felt insecurely perched on it,
      and his back was twisted in an unfamiliar way. If he rode astride for a
      while, during this secure, peaceful time, he reasoned that the rest of the
      journey would be easier for him when in full daylight he was obliged to
      play the girl decorously and be constantly on his guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      One leg swung over. He pressed his knees into the horse’s sides, and gave
      a suppressed whoop of joy. The horse sped forward, and just for practice,
      he jerked off his sunbonnet and swung it round and round his head by the
      strings; the blood danced in him; he leaned forward and gave a hissing
      chirrup to the horse; his petticoats flapped in the wind, and the trees
      fled hastily to the rear. Now was his chance for making time. To feel
      himself firmly and naturally seated on the horse was glorious. He swung
      the bonnet round his head again. One of the strings slipped from his hand
      and the other tore from the bonnet. The bonnet flew to<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_287"
        >[287]</span
      >
      the roadside, and before Neil could check his horse it was rods behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he rode back for it, a man stepped out of the woods and picked it from
      the bush where it had lodged. At sight of him Neil flung his stray leg
      back where it belonged, and blushed to a depth of embarrassment which
      would have done credit to any girl.
    </p>
    <p>“If you please, sir,” he said, “I just lost that bonnet.”</p>
    <p>
      The stranger held the bonnet behind him and laughed. He was a tall,
      broad-shouldered fellow with a face which made Neil sure that he was a man
      to be reckoned with. The features were large, yet mobile, and his pale,
      greenish eyes had a spark of mischief in them which looked as if it might
      turn to fire. Neil felt sorely perturbed, and he had no need to play a
      part in order to show timidity. Sandy Davidson came back into his mind;
      but if this were Sandy, there would be small chance to capture him in such
      a meeting, and the most Neil could hope was to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever the stranger might be, his first object was to tease. “What’ll you
      give me for it, Miss Tomboy?” he asked.
    </p>
    <p>“I—I don’t have anything to give you,” Neil stammered.</p>
    <p>
      “Then you’ll not get it,” the other said, slipping the bonnet inside his
      blouse. “You don’t really want it you know. Anybody can see from your
      brown face that you’re not used to wearing a bonnet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">[288]</span>“But I do want it!” Neil
      declared. He was wild with anxiety and had no idea what to do. If the man
      had not slipped it into his tunic, he might have ridden closer, snatched
      it, and galloped off.
    </p>
    <p>The man stood laughing at him. “I’ll swap it for a kiss,” he offered.</p>
    <p>
      Neil drew back. “No, you’ll not!” he cried angrily. His indignation was
      for himself rather than for the girl he pretended to be. As far as he
      could remember, neither his mother nor the Indians nor the soldiers had
      ever offered him a bargain of this kind. He had never been kissed since
      his babyhood. His face set, his blue eyes turned fierce, and he lifted the
      switch which he used as a riding whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger fell back a pace and stared with a look which was first
      startled and then keen. “You’re not a girl; you’re Neil Davidson!” he said
      abruptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil’s hand dropped. He stared back at the stranger. Something far away
      and dimly remembered, something which had made the boy tremble from the
      first, was in the man’s features. There was no question now. This was
      Sandy Davidson, and he had not only borrowed a name from Neil’s brother,
      he had borrowed a face.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they stood bewildered a faint sound reached them. Although distant,
      there was no mistaking the murmurous trample of many feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took Neil’s horse by the bridle. “You don’t deny that you’re Neil
      Davidson, and you’re my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">[289]</span>
      prisoner,” he said. “That’s Tarleton’s Legion. I was waiting here till it
      came by.”
    </p>
    <p>“Why do you think I’m Neil Davidson?”</p>
    <p>
      “Can’t you guess?” For the first time the man’s voice had a troubled
      sound. “It was when you got so mad. Your eyes blazed just as
      <i>hers</i> always did, and then all at once I could see your baby
      face—changed a lot, but looking right out at me. You always looked like
      mother.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil’s hand closed on the horn of the side-saddle. The name “Sandy
      Davidson” had not prepared him; the resemblance had seemed only an added
      insult.
    </p>
    <p>
      “You needn’t be afraid,” the other said, noticing how pale he had grown
      under his tan. “Since I heard of you in Greene’s army I’ve vowed I’d catch
      you, and now I have. Our family has done enough against the king. But I’ll
      see that nobody hurts you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil straightened himself with a jerk. His timidity was gone and his
      bewilderment was yielding to an understanding of what his mother had meant
      when she said that the Tories had killed Sandy. “And since I’ve heard of a
      Tory with my brother’s name, I’ve vowed to capture <i>him</i>!” he cried.
      “I’ve vowed that no Tory named Sandy Davidson should live, for mother said
      they’d killed you.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The other gave an impatient laugh. “Why don’t you capture me, then?” he
      asked. “Here I am. I told mother I was on the king’s side, and she said I
      was dead to her. She was growing crazy and driving<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_290"
        >[290]</span
      >
      me crazy begging me to revenge father’s death, when father was a rebel and
      deserved what he got. She drove me out of the house when I said I was a
      king’s man.” He shrugged his shoulders as if to put an end to accounting
      for himself. “Of course you’ve got messages on you, or you’d not be
      disguised. Hand them over and it will save you trouble. I’m your very
      affectionate brother, though you would like to collect that reward for me,
      but I can tell you Tarleton’s a very affectionate brother to nobody!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The sunbonnet with the letter in it was still in the front of Sandy’s
      hunting-shirt. “You can search me,” Neil said. “You’ll find no letters.”
    </p>
    <p>“Then what were you sent for?”</p>
    <p>
      “To practise riding on a side-saddle. You noticed that I don’t take very
      kindly to sitting this way.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “You’re pretty cool for a prisoner,” Sandy said approvingly. “I’ll search
      you fast enough, but I reckon we’ll be as good friends as when you wore
      dresses all the time.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Don’t think it!” Neil cried out. “Don’t think I’ll ever——” He checked
      himself, remembering that he was absolutely powerless in the hands of a
      man whose name stood for that all was unmerciful. If there was any kindly
      feeling left in such a man, Neil would need it. The trample of feet grew
      louder, and the brothers waited in silence, half-concealed by the clump of
      bushes on which the bonnet had caught.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil was busy with the possibilities of getting away.<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_291"
        >[291]</span
      >
      He looked at his brother critically, trying to judge what might be
      expected of him. Hard living, hard fighting, and cruelty had left
      strangely slight marks upon Sandy. His face was almost noble, suggesting
      possibilities which he was fast outliving.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy’s head began to whirl with remembrance of the days when he had
      toddled at Sandy’s heels; the two had shunned the house where their
      mother’s half-crazed talk of revenge left them no peace; they had stayed
      in the fields together; sometimes the big boy had teased the little one,
      but sometimes he had snatched Neil up and tossed and played with him,
      making him blissfully certain that they were of one age and stature—rough,
      loving mates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil’s only bright memories of home were of Sandy. It was because they
      were so bright that he had hated the Tory Sandy so much more than any
      other Tory; and yet this man, this bushwhacker and marauder, had spoken of
      the old days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once Neil leaned forward to ask him if he recalled some trifling
      circumstance which stood out with special plainness in his own
      recollection, but he could not form the words. Relive the past with a
      Tory? He shook his head savagely and looked in the direction of the
      approaching troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers were coming into view round a curve in the road—not
      Tarleton’s Legion, but a body of plainly dressed militia such as might be
      found in either army, such as might have reinforced Tarleton. For the<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_292"
        >[292]</span
      >
      space of a breath Sandy and Neil watched them. Then an officer galloped
      forward. The brightening daylight struck across his red hair and large,
      high-boned face. It was Col. William Campbell leading his riflemen to
      Greene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Sandy could stir Neil caught him by the arm. In their partial
      shelter they had not yet been seen. “If you run, I’ll call out your name
      and you’ll be a dead man!” he whispered. “That’s Campbell’s regiment, and
      you’re my prisoner! Give me back that bonnet. There’s a message in it to
      Colonel Campbell from General Greene!” His words grew swifter with
      triumph. “Oh, you laughed when I said I’d vowed to capture you. You were
      sure it was Tarleton’s regiment——”
    </p>
    <p>
      Sandy nodded. For once a surprise had dazed him and he stood quiescent,
      realizing that if Neil gave the alarm those grim-faced men would scour the
      woods and hunt him down. “Oh, I’m caught!” he acknowledged grimly. “You’ll
      have the pleasure of seeing me shot or hanged.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I said I’d capture you,” Neil repeated. “I said no Tory should live——”
      Something unexpected choked his words. The vision of deaths he had seen in
      the army passed before him, and then of two boys romping together in a
      field. It was only an instant, but the love and the hate of his life
      struggled together. He began to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      “The bonnet!” he begged. “If I have the bonnet I can hold their notice.”
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">[293]</span>“You mean you’ll help me
      off?” Sandy’s voice broke huskily. “Little Neil—I’ll remember this,
      I’ll——” But there was no time for words. He pulled the bonnet from his
      tunic, turned and walked coolly into the woods, just as the soldiers
      caught sight of Neil’s higher figure on the horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil rode to meet the regiment, holding his bonnet in his hands. He forgot
      his disguise and saluted like a soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Colonel Campbell, I’m not a girl. I’m Neil Davidson, and I’ve brought you
      a message from General Greene,” he said. “It’s sewed inside the bonnet.”
    </p>
    <p>
      But the colonel had caught a motion between the trees. “Who’s that moving
      off there?” he asked sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      “A man I was talking to,” Neil said. “I was riding fast and my bonnet flew
      off. A stranger stepped out of the woods and picked it up for me. He
      thought I was a girl, of course, and teased me at first. He wanted me to
      kiss him before he’d give it back. I was nearly wild on account of the
      message. Then we heard you coming. He stopped teasing and waited with me
      until I told him you were my friends.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “Humph! It’s pretty evident we weren’t his friends; but I reckon he’s not
      worth following!” the colonel commented. He tore open the bonnet, found
      the message in it, and troubled himself no more about the man in the
      woods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span>“Ah, Neil, you brought
      them in!” the general said, when Neil reported to him. As it chanced, the
      regiment would have arrived just as safely without the message, yet he let
      his grave, tired eyes rest approvingly on the boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neil had on his own tattered clothes again. His head was as shaggy and
      bare as usual, and his brown legs nearly as bare, but there was something
      unfamiliar in his face. “Yes, sir,” he answered impetuously. “I brought
      them in, but I let the worst Tory in the country go free.”
    </p>
    <p>Greene smiled half-incredulously. “Why was that?” he asked.</p>
    <p>
      Neil was silent a moment, and the general saw tears rising in the blue
      eyes that he had supposed were always shrewd or fierce.
    </p>
    <p>
      “He was my brother!” Neil broke out at last, and because his heart was so
      full that he had to tell some one, he told the big, considerate general
      the whole story. “And you may do what you please with me, general,” he
      ended. “I had to let him go free.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The general took the boy’s small, shaking hand. “I don’t think you let him
      go <i>free</i>, exactly, Neil,” he said. “That minute of mercy will make
      him more or less your captive all his life.”

      <p class="center">By <span class="smcap">Rupert S. Holland</span></p>
    </div>
    <div class="blockquot">
      <p>
        A little Scottish lad dreamed of a great sea fight—of a flag with red
        and white stripes, and white stars on a blue field. This story tells how
        his dream came true.
      </p>
    </div>
    <p class="drop-cap">
      THE summer afternoon was fair, and the waves that rolled upon the north
      shore of Solway Firth in the western Lowlands of Scotland were calm and
      even. But the tide was coming in, and inch by inch was covering the
      causeway that led from shore to a high rock some hundred yards away. The
      rock was bare of vegetation, and sheer on the landward side, but on the
      face toward the sea, were rough jutting points that would give a climber
      certain footholds, and near the top smooth ledges.
    </p>
    <p>
      On one or two of these ledges sea-gulls had built their nests, tucked in
      under projecting points where they would be sheltered from wind and rain.
      Now the gulls would sweep in from sea, curving in great circles until they
      reached their homes, and then would sit on the ledge calling to their
      mates across the water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span>
      Except for the cries of the gulls, however, the rock was very quiet. The
      lazy, regular beat of the waves about its base was very soothing. On the
      longest ledge, below the sea-gulls’ nests, lay a boy about twelve years
      old, sound asleep, his face turned toward the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Either the gulls’ cries or the sun, now slanting in the west, disturbed
      him. He did not open his eyes, but he clenched his fists, and muttered
      incoherently. Presently with a start he awoke. He rubbed his eyes, and
      then sat up. “What a queer dream!” he said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ledge where he sat was not a very safe place. There was scarcely room
      for him to move, and directly below him was the sea. But this boy was
      quite as much at home on high rocks or in the water as he was on land, and
      he was very fond of looking out for distant sailing-vessels and wondering
      where they might be bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced along the north shore to the little fishing hamlet of Arbigland
      where he lived. He saw that the tide had come in rapidly while he slept,
      and that the path to the shore was now covered. He stood up and stretched
      his bare arms, brown with sunburn, high over his head. Then he started to
      climb down from the ledge by the jutting points of rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was as sure-footed as any mountaineer. His clothes were old, so neither
      rock nor sea could do them much harm; his feet were bare. He was short but
      very broad, and his muscles were strong and supple. When he came to the
      foot of the rock he stood a moment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297"
        >[297]</span
      >
      hunting for the deepest pool at its base, then, loosing his hold, he dove
      into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few seconds he was up again, floating on his back; and a little later
      he struck out, swimming hand over hand, toward a sandy beach to the south.
    </p>
    <p>
      A young man, wearing the uniform of a lieutenant in the British navy,
      stood on the beach, watching the boy swim. When the latter had landed and
      shaken the water from him much as a dog would, the man approached him.
      “Where on earth did you come from, John Paul?” he asked with a laugh. “The
      first thing I knew I saw you swimming in from sea.”
    </p>
    <p>
      “I was out on the rock asleep,” said the boy. “The tide came up and cut me
      off. And oh, Lieutenant Pearson, I had the strangest dream! I dreamt I was
      in the middle of a great sea fight. I was captain of a ship, and her
      yard-arms were on fire, and we were pouring broadsides into the enemy,
      afraid any minute that we’d sink. How we did fight that ship.”
    </p>
    <p>
      The young officer’s eyes glowed. “And I hope you may some day, John!” he
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “But the strangest part was that our ship didn’t fly the English flag,”
      said the boy. “At the masthead was a flag I’d never seen, red and white
      with a blue field filled with stars in the corner. What country’s flag is
      that?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearson thought for a moment. “There’s no such flag,” he said finally. “I
      know them all, and there’s none like that. The rest of your dream may
      come<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">[298]</span> true, but not that
      about the flag. Come, let’s be walking back to Arbigland.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Although John Paul’s father came of peaceful farmer and fisher folk who
      lived about Solway Firth, his mother had been a “Highland lassie,”
      descended from one of the fighting clans in the Grampian Hills. The boy
      had much of the Highlander’s love of wild adventure, and found it hard to
      live the simple life of the fishing village. The sea appealed to him, and
      he much preferred it to the small Scotch parish school. His family were
      poor, and as soon as he was able he was set to steering fishing yawls and
      hauling lines. At twelve he was as sturdy and capable as most boys at
      twenty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many men in Arbigland had heard John Paul beg his father to let him cross
      the Solway to the port of Whitehaven and ship on some vessel bound for
      America, where his older brother William had found a new home. But his
      father saw no opening for his younger son in such a life. All the way back
      to town that afternoon the boy told Lieutenant Pearson of his great
      desire, and the young officer said he would try to help him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy’s chance, however, came in another way. A few days later it
      chanced that Mr. James Younger, a big ship-owner, was on the landing-place
      of Arbigland when some of the villagers caught sight of a small fishing
      yawl beating up against a stiff northeast squall, trying to gain the
      shelter of the little tidal creek that formed the harbor of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>Mr. Younger looked long at
      the boat and then shook his head. “I don’t think she’ll do it,” he said
      dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet the boat came on, and he could soon see that the only crew were a man
      and a boy. The boy was steering, handling the sheets and giving orders,
      while the man simply sat on the gunwale to trim the boat.
    </p>
    <p>“Who’s the boy?” asked the ship-owner.</p>
    <p>“John Paul,” said a bystander. “That’s his father there.”</p>
    <p>
      Mr. Younger looked at the man pointed out, who was standing near, and who
      did not seem to be in the least alarmed. “Are you the lad’s father?” he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked up and nodded. “Yes, that’s my boy John conning the boat,”
      said he. “He’ll fetch her in. This isn’t much of a squall for him!”
    </p>
    <p>
      The father spoke with truth. The boy handled his small craft with such
      skill that he soon had her alongside the wharf. As soon as John Paul had
      landed Mr. Younger stepped up to the father and asked to be introduced to
      the son. Then the ship-owner told him how much he had admired his
      seamanship, and asked if he would care to sail as master’s apprentice in a
      new vessel he owned, which was fitting out for a voyage to Virginia and
      the West Indies. The boy’s eyes danced with delight; he begged his father
      to let him go, and finally Mr. Paul consented. The twelve-year-old boy had
      won his wish to go to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days later the brig <i>Friendship</i> sailed from Whitehaven,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_300"
        >[300]</span
      >
      with small John Paul on board, and after a slow voyage which lasted
      thirty-two days dropped anchor in the Rappahannock River of Virginia.
    </p>
    <p>
      The life of a colonial trader was very pleasant in 1760. The
      sailing-vessels usually made a triangular voyage, taking some six months
      to go from England to the colonies, then to the West Indies, and so east
      again. About three of the six months were spent at the small settlements
      on shore, discharging goods from England, taking on board cotton and
      tobacco, and bartering with the merchants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Virginians who lived on their great plantations with many servants
      were the most hospitable people in the world, always eager to entertain a
      stranger, and the English sailors were given the freedom of the shore. The
      <i>Friendship</i> anchored a short distance down the river from where John
      Paul’s older brother lived, and the boy immediately went to see him and
      stayed as his guest for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      This brother William had been adopted by a wealthy planter named Jones,
      and the latter was delighted with the young John Paul, and tried to get
      him to leave the sailor’s life and settle on the Rappahannock. But much as
      John liked the easy life of the plantation, the fine riding horses, the
      wide fields and splendid rivers, the call of the sea was dearer to him,
      and when the <i>Friendship</i> dropped down the Rappahannock bound for
      Tobago and the Barbadoes he was on board of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those were adventurous days for sailors and merchants.<span

      Money was to be made in many ways, and consciences were not overcareful as
      to the ways. The prosperous traders of Virginia did not mind taking an
      interest in some ocean rover bound on pirates’ business, or in the more
      lawful slave-trade with the west coast of Africa. For a time, however,
      young John Paul sailed for Mr. Younger, and was finally paid by being
      given a one-sixth interest in a ship called
      <i>King George’s Packet</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was now first mate, and trade with England being dull, he and the
      captain decided to try the slave-trade. They made prosperous voyages
      between Jamaica and the coast of Guinea, helping to found the fortunes of
      some of the best-known families of America by importing slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a year, however, John Paul tired of the business, and sold his share
      of the ship to the captain for about one thousand guineas. He was not yet
      twenty-one, but his seafaring life had already made him fairly well-to-do.
      He planned to go home and see his family in Scotland, and took passage in
      the brig <i>John o’ Gaunt</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life on shipboard was full of perils then, and very soon after the brig
      had cleared the Windward Islands the terrible scourge of yellow fever was
      found to be on the vessel. Within a few days the captain, the mate, and
      all of the crew but five had died of the disease. John Paul was fully
      exposed to it, but he and the five men escaped it. He was the only one of
      those left who knew anything about navigation, so he took command,<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_302"
        >[302]</span
      >
      and after a stormy passage, with a crew much too small to handle the brig,
      he managed to bring her safely to Whitehaven with all her cargo. He
      handled her as skilfully as he had the small yawl in Solway Firth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owners of the <i>John o’ Gaunt</i> were delighted and gave John Paul
      and his five sailors the ten per cent. share of the cargo which the
      salvage laws entitled them to. In addition they offered him the command of
      a splendid full-rigged new merchantman which was to sail between England
      and America, and a tenth share of all profits. It was a very fine offer to
      a man who had barely come of age, but the youth had shown that he had few
      equals as a mariner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good fortune shone upon him. He had no sooner sailed up the Rappahannock
      again and landed at the plantation where his brother lived than he learned
      that the rich old Virginian, William Jones, had recently died and in his
      will had named him as one of his heirs. He had always cherished a fancy
      for the sturdy, black-haired boy who had made him that visit. The will
      provided that John Paul should add the planter’s name to his own. The
      young captain did not object to this, and so henceforth he was known as
      John Paul Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scores of stories are told of the young captain’s adventures. He loved
      danger, and it was his nature to enjoy a fight with men or with the
      elements. On a voyage to Jamaica he met with serious trouble. Fever again
      reduced the crew to six men, and Jones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303"
        >[303]</span
      >
      was the only officer able to be on deck. A huge negro named Maxwell tried
      to start a mutiny and capture the ship for his own uses. He rushed at
      Jones, and the latter had to seize a belaying-pin and hit him over the
      head. The man fell, badly hurt, and soon after reaching Jamaica died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones gave himself up to the authorities and was tried for murder on the
      high seas. He said to the court: “I had two brace of loaded pistols in my
      belt, and could easily have shot him. I struck with a belaying-pin in
      preference, because I hoped that I might subdue him without killing him.”
      He was acquitted, and soon after offered command of a new ship built to
      trade with India.
    </p>
    <p>
      The charm of life in Virginia appealed more and more strongly to the
      sailor. He liked the new country, the society of the young cities along
      the Atlantic Coast, and he spent less time on the high seas and more time
      fishing and hunting on his own land and in Chesapeake Bay. He might have
      settled quietly into such prosperous retirement had not the minute-men of
      Concord startled the new world into stirring action.
    </p>
    <p>
      John Paul Jones loved America and he loved ships. Consequently he was one
      of the very first to offer his services in building a new navy. Congress
      was glad to have him; he was known as a man of the greatest courage and of
      supreme nautical skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      On September 23, 1779, Paul Jones, on board the American ship
      <i>Bon Homme Richard</i>, met the British<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_304"
        >[304]</span
      >
      frigate <i>Serapis</i> off the English coast. A battle of giants followed,
      for both ships were manned by brave crews and commanded by extraordinarily
      skilful officers. The short, black-haired, agile American commander saw
      his ship catch fire, stood on his quarter-deck while the blazing spars,
      sails, and rigging fell about him, while his men were mowed down by the
      terrific broadsides of the <i>Serapis</i>, and calmly directed the fire of
      shot at the enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Terribly as the <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> suffered, the <i>Serapis</i> was
      in still worse plight. Two thirds of her men were killed or wounded when
      Paul Jones gave the signal to board her. The Americans swarmed over the
      enemy’s bulwarks, and, armed with pistol and cutlass, cleared the deck.
    </p>
    <p>
      The captain of the <i>Serapis</i> fought his ship to the last, but when he
      saw the Americans sweeping everything before them and already heading for
      the quarter-deck, he himself seized the ensign halyards and struck his
      flag. Both ships were in flames, and the smoke was so thick that it was
      some minutes before the men realized his surrender. There was little to
      choose between the two vessels; each was a floating mass of wreckage.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little later the English captain went on board the
      <i>Bon Homme Richard</i> and tendered his sword to the young American. The
      latter looked hard at the English officer. “Captain Pearson?” he asked
      questioningly. The other bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Ah, I thought so. I am John Paul Jones, once<span
        class="pagenum"
        id="Page_305"
        >[305]</span
      >
      small John Paul of Arbigland in the Firth. Do you remember me?”
    </p>
    <p>
      Pearson looked at the smoke-grimed face, the keen black eyes, the fine
      figure. “I shouldn’t have known you. Yes, I remember now.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Paul Jones took the sword that was held out to him, and asked one of his
      midshipmen to escort the British captain to his cabin. He could not help
      smiling as a curious recollection came to him. He looked up at the
      masthead above him. There floated a flag bearing thirteen red and white
      stripes and a blue corner filled with stars. It was the very flag of his
      dream as a boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it was that the sturdy Scotch boy, full of the daring spirit of his
      Highland ancestors, became the great sea-fighter of a new country, and
      ultimately wrote his name in history as the Father of the American Navy.

        Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
        law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so
        the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
        States without permission and without paying copyright royalties.
        Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this
        license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic
        works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™ concept and trademark. Project
        Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge
        for an eBook, except by following the terms of the trademark license,
        including paying royalties for use of the Project Gutenberg trademark.
        If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with
        the trademark license is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly
        any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances
        and research. Project Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and
        given away—you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with

        to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that
        you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without
        complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C
        below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™

        1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation”
        or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
        Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the
        collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an
        individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and
        you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent
        you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating
        derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project
        Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the
        Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works
        by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms
        of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated
        with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
        keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
        Gutenberg™ License when you share it without charge with others.

        the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
        before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or

        The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
        charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United

        with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where

        editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
        the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
        necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.
